        "summary": "  Problem gambling is a major public health concern and is associated with\nprofound psychological distress and economic problems. There are numerous\ngambling communities on the internet where users exchange information about\ngames, gambling tactics, as well as gambling-related problems. Individuals\nexhibiting higher levels of problem gambling engage more in such communities.\nOnline gambling communities may provide insights into problem-gambling\nbehaviour. Using data scraped from a major German gambling discussion board, we\nfine-tuned a large language model, specifically a Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) model, to predict signs of\nproblem-gambling from forum posts. Training data were generated by manual\nannotation and by taking into account diagnostic criteria and gambling-related\ncognitive distortions. Using k-fold cross-validation, our models achieved a\nprecision of 0.95 and F1 score of 0.71, demonstrating that satisfactory\nclassification performance can be achieved by generating high-quality training\nmaterial through manual annotation based on diagnostic criteria. The current\nstudy confirms that a BERT-based model can be reliably used on small data sets\nand to detect signatures of problem gambling in online communication data. Such\ncomputational approaches may have potential for the detection of changes in\nproblem-gambling prevalence among online users.\n",

        "summary": "  The statistical concept of Gambler's Ruin suggests that gambling has a large\namount of risk. Nevertheless, gambling at casinos and gambling on the Internet\nare both hugely popular activities. In recent years, both prospect theory and\nlab-controlled experiments have been used to improve our understanding of risk\nattitudes associated with gambling. Despite theoretical progress, collecting\nreal-life gambling data, which is essential to validate predictions and\nexperimental findings, remains a challenge. To address this issue, we collect\npublicly available betting data from a \\emph{DApp} (decentralized application)\non the Ethereum Blockchain, which instantly publishes the outcome of every\nsingle bet (consisting of each bet's timestamp, wager, probability of winning,\nuserID, and profit). This online casino is a simple dice game that allows\ngamblers to tune their own winning probabilities. Thus the dataset is well\nsuited for studying gambling strategies and the complex dynamic of risk\nattitudes involved in betting decisions. We analyze the dataset through the\nlens of current probability-theoretic models and discover empirical examples of\ngambling systems. Our results shed light on understanding the role of risk\npreferences in human financial behavior and decision-makings beyond gambling.\n",

Whilst\nincreasingly stringent regulations have been applied over the years to prevent\nmoney laundering in gambling, despite this, online gambling is still a channel\nfor criminals to spend proceeds from crime. Complementing online gambling's\ngrowth more concerns are raised to its effects compared with gambling in\ntraditional, physical formats, as it might introduce higher levels of problem\ngambling or fraudulent behaviour due to its nature of immediate interaction\nwith online gambling experience. However, in most cases the main issue when\norganisations try to tackle those areas is the absence of high quality data.\nSince fraud detection related issues face the significant problem of the class\nimbalance, in this paper we propose a novel system based on Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data in order to train a\nsupervised classifier. Our framework Synthetic Data Generation GAN (SDG-GAN),\nmanages to outperformed density based over-sampling methods and improve the\nclassification performance of benchmarks datasets and the real world gambling\nfraud dataset.\n",

In fact, even if we restrict the gambles\nto be polynomials in R^n , the problem of determining nonnegativity is NP-hard.\nThe aim of this paper is to develop a computable theory of desirable gambles.\nInstead of requiring the subject to accept all nonnegative gambles, we only\nrequire her to accept gambles for which she can efficiently determine the\nnonnegativity (in particular SOS polynomials).

The\ndifficulty of this inference depends on factors including the details of the\ngambles offered and the number of iterations of the game played. In this paper\nwe explore in detail the practical challenges of inferring risk preferences\nfrom the observed choices of artificial agents who are presented with finite\nsequences of repeated gambles. We are motivated by the fact that the strategy\nto maximize long-run wealth for sequences of repeated additive gambles (where\ngains and losses are independent of current wealth) is different to the\nstrategy for repeated multiplicative gambles (where gains and losses are\nproportional to current wealth.) Accurate measurement of risk preferences would\nbe needed to tell whether an agent is employing the optimal strategy or not. To\ngeneralize the types of gambles our agents face we use the Yeo-Johnson\ntransformation, a tool borrowed from feature engineering for time series\nanalysis, to construct a family of gambles that interpolates smoothly between\nthe additive and multiplicative cases. We then analyze the optimal strategy for\nthis family, both analytically and numerically. We find that it becomes\nincreasingly difficult to distinguish the risk preferences of agents as their\nwealth increases. This is because agents with different risk preferences\neventually make the same decisions for sufficiently high wealth. We believe\nthat these findings are informative for the effective design of experiments to\nmeasure risk preferences in humans.\n",

        "summary": "  Financial and gambling markets are ostensibly similar and hence strategies\nfrom one could potentially be applied to the other. Financial markets have been\nextensively studied, resulting in numerous theorems and models, while gambling\nmarkets have received comparatively less attention and remain relatively\nundocumented. This study conducts a comprehensive comparison of both markets,\nfocusing on trading rather than regulation. Five key aspects are examined:\nplatform, product, procedure, participant and strategy. The findings reveal\nnumerous similarities between these two markets. Financial exchanges resemble\nonline betting platforms, such as Betfair, and some financial products,\nincluding stocks and options, share speculative traits with sports betting. We\nexamine whether well-established models and strategies from financial markets\ncould be applied to the gambling industry, which lacks comparable frameworks.\nFor example, statistical arbitrage from financial markets has been effectively\napplied to gambling markets, particularly in peer-to-peer betting exchanges,\nwhere bettors exploit odds discrepancies for risk-free profits using\nquantitative models. Therefore, exploring the strategies and approaches used in\nboth markets could lead to new opportunities for innovation and optimization in\ntrading and betting activities.\n",

In our related work, we introduced function-coherent gambles to\naccommodate non-linear utility. However, when repeated gambles are played over\ntime -- especially in intertemporal choice where rewards compound\nmultiplicatively -- the standard additive combination axiom fails to capture\nthe appropriate long-run evaluation. In this paper we extend the framework by\nrelaxing the additive combination axiom and introducing a nonlinear combination\noperator that effectively aggregates repeated gambles in the log-domain. This\noperator preserves the time-average (geometric) growth rate and addresses the\nergodicity problem. We prove the key algebraic properties of the operator,\ndiscuss its impact on coherence, risk assessment, and representation, and\nprovide a series of illustrative examples. Our approach bridges the gap between\nexpectation values and time averages and unifies normative theory with\nempirically observed non-stationary reward dynamics.\n",

Expectation\nvalue maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values\nare only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic\nproperties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles and the\nvariables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the\nrelevant ergodic properties.

No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be\nspecified to compute time averages. Linear and logarithmic \"utility functions\"\nappear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive\nand purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively.

        "summary": "  This work proposes a transformer architecture for user-level classification\nof gambling addiction and depression that is trainable end-to-end. As opposed\nto other methods that operate at the post level, we process a set of social\nmedia posts from a particular individual, to make use of the interactions\nbetween posts and eliminate label noise at the post level. We exploit the fact\nthat, by not injecting positional encodings, multi-head attention is\npermutation invariant and we process randomly sampled sets of texts from a user\nafter being encoded with a modern pretrained sentence encoder (RoBERTa /\nMiniLM). Moreover, our architecture is interpretable with modern feature\nattribution methods and allows for automatic dataset creation by identifying\ndiscriminating posts in a user's text-set. We perform ablation studies on\nhyper-parameters and evaluate our method for the eRisk 2022 Lab on early\ndetection of signs of pathological gambling and early risk detection of\ndepression. The method proposed by our team BLUE obtained the best ERDE5 score\nof 0.015, and the second-best ERDE50 score of 0.009 for pathological gambling\ndetection. For the early detection of depression, we obtained the second-best\nERDE50 of 0.027.\n",

This paper proposes a new approach to constructing CSs for means\nof bounded multivariate stochastic processes using a general gambling\nframework, extending the recently established coin toss framework for bounded\nrandom processes. The proposed gambling framework provides a general recipe for\nconstructing CSs for categorical and probability-vector-valued observations, as\nwell as for general bounded multidimensional observations through a simple\nreduction. This paper specifically explores the use of the mixture portfolio,\nakin to Cover's universal portfolio, in the proposed framework and investigates\nthe properties of the resulting CSs. Simulations demonstrate the tightness of\nthese confidence sequences compared to existing methods. When applied to the\nsampling without-replacement setting for finite categorical data, it is shown\nthat the resulting CS based on a universal gambling strategy is provably\ntighter than that of the posterior-prior ratio martingale proposed by\nWaudby-Smith and Ramdas.\n",

To tackle this problem, this paper focuses on\nincorporating temporal and emotional features into the model. The preprocessing\nphase involves dealing with the time irregularity of posts by padding\nsequences. Two baseline architectures are used for preliminary evaluation: BERT\nclassifier on concatenated posts per user and GRU with LSTM on sequential data.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the sequential models outperform the\nconcatenation-based model. The results of the experiments conclude that the\nincorporation of a time decay layer (TD) and passing the emotion classification\nlayer (EmoBERTa) through LSTM improves the performance significantly.\nExperiments concluded that the addition of a self-attention layer didn't\nsignificantly improve the performance of the model, however provided easily\ninterpretable attention scores. The developed architecture with the inclusion\nof EmoBERTa and TD layers achieved a high F1 score, beating existing benchmarks\non pathological gambling dataset. Future work may involve the early prediction\nof risk factors associated with pathological gambling disorder and testing\nmodels on other datasets. Overall, this research highlights the significance of\nthe sequential processing of posts including temporal and emotional features to\nboost the predictive power, as well as adding an attention layer for\ninterpretability.\n",

        "summary": "  A gambler walks into a hypothetical fair casino with a very real dollar bill,\nbut by the time he leaves he's exchanged the dollar for a random amount of\nmoney. What is lost in the process? It may be that the gambler walks out at the\nend of the day, after a roller-coaster ride of winning and losing, with his\ndollar still intact, or maybe even with two dollars. But what the gambler loses\nthe moment he places his first bet is position. He exchanges one distribution\nof money for a distribution of lesser quality, from which he cannot return. Our\nfirst discussion in this work connects known results of economic inequality and\nmajorization to the probability theory of gambling and Martingales. We provide\na simple proof that fair gambles cannot increase the Lorenz curve, and we also\nconstructively demonstrate that any sequence of non-increasing Lorenz curves\ncorresponds to at least one Martingale.\n  We next consider the efficiency of gambles. If all fair gambles are available\nthen one can move down the lattice of distributions defined by the Lorenz\nordering. However, the step from one distribution to the next is not unique. Is\nthere a sense of efficiency with which one can move down the Lorenz stream? One\napproach would be to minimize the average total volume of money placed on the\ntable. In this case, it turns out that implementing part of the strategy using\nprivate randomness can help reduce the need for the casino's randomness,\nresulting in less money on the table that the casino cannot get its hands on.\n",

In the field of physics, it was recently shown\nthat mutual information can characterize the maximal amount of work that can be\nextracted from a single heat bath using measurement-based control protocols,\ni.e., using \"information engines\". However, to the best of our knowledge, no\nrelation between gambling and information engines has been presented before. In\nthis paper, we briefly review the two concepts and then demonstrate an analogy\nbetween gambling, where bits are converted into wealth, and information\nengines, where bits representing measurements are converted into energy. From\nthis analogy follows an extension of gambling to the continuous-valued case,\nwhich is shown to be useful for investments in currency exchange rates or in\nthe stock market using options. Moreover, the analogy enables us to use\nwell-known methods and results from one field to solve problems in the other.\nWe present three such cases: maximum work extraction when the probability\ndistributions governing the system and measurements are unknown, work\nextraction when some energy is lost in each cycle, e.g., due to friction, and\nan analysis of systems with memory. In all three cases, the analogy enables us\nto use known results in order to obtain new ones.\n",

        "summary": "  Fighting Fantasy is a popular recreational fantasy gaming system worldwide.\nCombat in this system progresses through a stochastic game involving a series\nof rounds, each of which may be won or lost. Each round, a limited resource\n(`luck') may be spent on a gamble to amplify the benefit from a win or mitigate\nthe deficit from a loss. However, the success of this gamble depends on the\namount of remaining resource, and if the gamble is unsuccessful, benefits are\nreduced and deficits increased. Players thus dynamically choose to expend\nresource to attempt to influence the stochastic dynamics of the game, with\ndiminishing probability of positive return. The identification of the optimal\nstrategy for victory is a Markov decision problem that has not yet been solved.\nHere, we combine stochastic analysis and simulation with dynamic programming to\ncharacterise the dynamical behaviour of the system in the absence and presence\nof gambling policy. We derive a simple expression for the victory probability\nwithout luck-based strategy. We use a backward induction approach to solve the\nBellman equation for the system and identify the optimal strategy for any given\nstate during the game. The optimal control strategies can dramatically enhance\nsuccess probabilities, but take detailed forms; we use stochastic simulation to\napproximate these optimal strategies with simple heuristics that can be\npractically employed. Our findings provide a roadmap to improving success in\nthe games that millions of people play worldwide, and inform a class of\nresource allocation problems with diminishing returns in stochastic games.\n",

This paper extends the definition of\nduality index to all outcomes including all gambles, and considers a portfolio\nselection problem in a complete market, in which the agent's target is to\nminimize the index of the utility of the relative investment outcome. By\nlinking this problem to a series of Merton's optimum consumption-like problems,\nthe optimal solution is explicitly derived. It is shown that if the prior\nbenchmark level is too high (which can be verified), then the investment risk\nwill be beyond any agent's risk tolerance. If the benchmark level is\nreasonable, then the optimal solution will be the same as that of one of the\nMerton's series problems, but with a particular value of absolute risk\naversion, which is given by an explicit algebraic equation as a part of the\noptimal solution.

        "summary": "  In classic Kelly gambling, bets are chosen to maximize the expected log\ngrowth of wealth, under a known probability distribution. Breiman provides\nrigorous mathematical proofs that Kelly strategy maximizes the rate of asset\ngrowth (asymptotically maximal magnitude property), which is thought of as the\nprincipal justification for selecting expected logarithmic utility as the guide\nto portfolio selection. Despite very nice theoretical properties, the classic\nKelly strategy is rarely used in practical portfolio allocation directly due to\npractically unavoidable uncertainty. In this paper we consider the\ndistributional robust version of the Kelly gambling problem, in which the\nprobability distribution is not known, but lies in a given set of possible\ndistributions. The bet is chosen to maximize the worst-case (smallest) expected\nlog growth among the distributions in the given set.\n  Computationally, this distributional robust Kelly gambling problem is convex,\nbut in general need not be tractable. We show that it can be tractably solved\nin a number of useful cases when there is a finite number of outcomes with\nstandard tools from disciplined convex programming.\n  Theoretically, in sequential decision making with varying distribution within\na given uncertainty set, we prove that distributional robust Kelly strategy\nasymptotically maximizes the worst-case rate of asset growth, and dominants any\nother essentially different strategy by magnitude. Our results extends\nBreiman's theoretical result and justifies that the distributional robust Kelly\nstrategy is the optimal strategy in the long-run for practical betting with\nuncertainty.\n",

        "summary": "  Research on the convergence of gaming and gambling has been around since the\n1990s. The emergence of loot boxes in video games in the mid 2010s, a game\nmechanic with a chance-based outcome that shares structural and psychological\nsimilarities to gambling, caused public controversy and lead to the inception\nof a new field of study, loot box research. Since then, various studies have\nfound a relationship between loot box engagement and problem gambling as well\nas problem gaming. Due to the cross-sectional nature of this data, however,\ninferences about causality are limited. While loot box research has extensively\ninvestigated the relationship between loot box engagement and problem\nbehaviour, little research has been done to explain the underlying motivations\nof players that drive them to interact with loot boxes. The goal of this thesis\nis to provide possible explanations for the relationship between loot box\nengagement and problem gamblers or problem gamers. In doing so, it draws upon\ntwo prominent psychological theories. Self-Determination Theory and the\nDualistic Model of Passion. Self-Determination Theory's concept of\npsychological needs and their satisfaction or frustration is hereby used to\nexplain the development of harmonious or obsessive passions, which are\nintroduced in the Dualistic Model of Passion. These obsessive passions have\nbeen shown to be possible antecedents of behavioural addictions, such as\nproblem gambling or problem gaming. Thus, the interplay between needs, passions\nand loot box opening could elucidate the aforementioned correlations between\nloot box engagement and problem behaviour. However, further research,\nespecially utilising longitudinal data, is needed to better understand these\nprocesses.\n",

Psychologists and behavioral economists also make use of\nconcepts such as loss aversion and probability weighting to model risk\naversion. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that loss aversion has its\norigins in relatively ancient neural circuitries (e.g., ventral striatum).\nCould there thus be an evolutionary origin to risk avoidance? We study this\nquestion by evolving strategies that adapt to play the equivalent mean payoff\ngamble. We hypothesize that risk aversion in the equivalent mean payoff gamble\nis beneficial as an adaptation to living in small groups, and find that a\npreference for risk averse strategies only evolves in small populations of less\nthan 1,000 individuals, while agents exhibit no such strategy preference in\nlarger populations. Further, we discover that risk aversion can also evolve in\nlarger populations, but only when the population is segmented into small groups\nof around 150 individuals. Finally, we observe that risk aversion only evolves\nwhen the gamble is a rare event that has a large impact on the individual's\nfitness. These findings align with earlier reports that humans lived in small\ngroups for a large portion of their evolutionary history. As such, we suggest\nthat rare, high-risk, high-payoff events such as mating and mate competition\ncould have driven the evolution of risk averse behavior in humans living in\nsmall groups.\n",

Unlike\ngames like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill\ngame' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem,\nwhose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal\nwinning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a\nstrategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore,\nin order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances\nof rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges. Recently,\na work on this topic revealed that rationality is a fundamental ingredient to\nsucceed in poker tournaments. In this study we analyze a simple model of poker\nchallenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the\nnature of this game. As main result we found that, under particular conditions,\nfew irrational players can turn poker into gambling. Therefore, although\nrationality is a key ingredient to succeed in poker, also the format of\nchallenges has an important role in these dynamics, as it can strongly\ninfluence the underlying nature of the game. The importance of our results lies\non related implications, as for instance in identifying the limits poker can be\nconsidered as a `skill game' and, as a consequence, which kind of format must\nbe chosen to devise algorithms able to face humans.\n",

For\nexample, humans often maximize their expected reward when gambling and this is\nconsidered as a \"rational\" decision. However, humans tend to change their\nbetting strategies depending on how they \"feel\". If someone has experienced a\nlosing streak, they may \"feel\" that they are more likely to win on the next\nhand even though the odds of the game have not changed. That is, their\ndecisions are driven by their emotional state. In this paper, we investigate\nhow the human brain responds to wins and losses during gambling. Using a\ncombination of local field potential recordings in human subjects performing a\nfinancial decision-making task, spectral analyses, and non-parametric cluster\nstatistics, we investigated whether neural responses in different cognitive and\nlimbic brain areas differ between wins and losses after decisions are made. In\neleven subjects, the neural activity modulated significantly between win and\nloss trials in one brain region: the anterior insula ($p=0.01$). In particular,\ngamma activity (30-70 Hz) increased in the anterior insula when subjects just\nrealized that they won. Modulation of metabolic activity in the anterior insula\nhas been observed previously in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies\nduring decision making and when emotions are elicited. However, our study is\nable to characterize temporal dynamics of electrical activity in this brain\nregion at the millisecond resolution while decisions are made and after\noutcomes are revealed.\n",

To begin, a player creates an arbitrary series of consecutive\nintegers with a sum equal to the desired profit from multiple rounds of\nbetting. Using the system, a player will either win an amount equal to the sum\nof the elements of the initial series or lose all of their available capital.\nThis sequence was simulated multiple times to determine the statistical\ncharacteristics of both the return and of the loss in an average round of\nbetting. By running the simulations of millions of rounds of Labouchere, it was\npossible to discern the probable outcomes of running the system using the\nLabouchere gambling sequence and plotting the results on a graph to map the\naverage return on the initial capital investment. The Labouchere system is very\npsychologically appealing to players because when applied over time it provides\nvery consistent linear returns.

        "summary": "  Several consistency notions are available for a lower prevision P assessed on\na set D of gambles (bounded random variables), ranging from the well known\ncoherence to convexity and to the recently introduced 2-coherence and\n2-convexity. In all these instances, a procedure with remarkable features,\ncalled (coherent, convex, 2-coherent or 2-convex) natural extension, is\navailable to extend P, preserving its consistency properties, to an arbitrary\nsuperset of gambles. We analyse the 2-coherent and 2-convex natural extensions,\nE_2 and E_2c respectively, showing that they may coincide with the other\nextensions in certain, special but rather common, cases of `full' conditional\nlower prevision or probability assessments. This does generally not happen if P\nis a(n unconditional) lower probability on the powerset of a given partition\nand is extended to the gambles defined on the same partition. In this framework\nwe determine alternative formulae for E_2 and E_2c. We also show that E_2c may\nbe nearly vacuous in some sense, while the Choquet integral extension is\n2-coherent if P is, and bounds from above the 2-coherent natural extension.\nRelationships between the finiteness of the various natural extensions and\nconditions of avoiding sure loss or weaker are also pointed out.\n",

        "summary": "  In the UK betting market, bookmakers often offer a free coupon to new\ncustomers. These free coupons allow the customer to place extra bets, at lower\nrisk, in combination with the usual betting odds. We are interested in whether\na customer can exploit these free coupons in order to make a sure gain, and if\nso, how the customer can achieve this. To answer this question, we evaluate the\nodds and free coupons as a set of desirable gambles for the bookmaker. We show\nthat we can use the Choquet integral to check whether this set of desirable\ngambles incurs sure loss for the bookmaker, and hence, results in a sure gain\nfor the customer. In the latter case, we also show how a customer can determine\nthe combination of bets that make the best possible gain, based on\ncomplementary slackness. As an illustration, we look at some actual betting\nodds in the market and find that, without free coupons, the set of desirable\ngambles derived from those odds avoids sure loss. However, with free coupons,\nwe identify some combinations of bets that customers could place in order to\nmake a guaranteed gain.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper presents the design of a cooperative multi-player betting game,\nTrust-ya, as a model of some elements of status processes in human groups. The\ngame is designed to elicit status-driven leader-follower behaviours as a means\nto observe and influence social hierarchy. It involves a Bach/Stravinsky game\nof deference in a group, in which people on each turn can either invest with\nanother player or hope someone invests with them. Players who receive\ninvestment capital are able to gamble for payoffs from a central pool which\nthen can be shared back with those who invested (but a portion of it may be\nkept, including all of it). The bigger gambles (people with more investors) get\nbigger payoffs. Thus, there is a natural tendency for players to coalesce as\ninvestors around a 'leader' who gambles, but who also shares sufficiently from\ntheir winnings to keep the investors 'hanging on'. The 'leader' will want to\nkeep as much as possible for themselves, however. The game is played\nanonymously, but a set of 'status symbols' can be purchased which have no value\nin the game itself, but can serve as a 'cheap talk' communication device with\nother players. This paper introduces the game, relates it to status theory in\nsocial psychology, and shows some simple simulated and human experiments that\ndemonstrate how the game can be used to study status processes and dynamics in\nhuman groups.\n",

This\nwork contributes to this domain by formalizing the problem of churn prediction\nin the context of online gambling as a binary classification task. We also\npropose an algorithmic answer to this problem based on recurrent neural\nnetwork. This algorithm is tested with online gambling data that have the form\nof time series, which can be efficiently processed by recurrent neural\nnetworks. To evaluate the performances of the trained models, standard machine\nlearning metrics were used, such as accuracy, precision and recall. For this\nproblem in particular, the conducted experiments allowed to assess that the\nchoice of a specific architecture depends on the metric which is given the\ngreatest importance. Architectures using nBRC favour precision, those using\nLSTM give better recall, while GRU-based architectures allow a higher accuracy\nand balance two other metrics. Moreover, further experiments showed that using\nonly the more recent time-series histories to train the networks decreases the\nquality of the results. We also study the performances of models learned at a\nspecific instant $t$, at other times $t^{\\prime} > t$. The results show that\nthe performances of the models learned at time $t$ remain good at the following\ninstants $t^{\\prime} > t$, suggesting that there is no need to refresh the\nmodels at a high rate. However, the performances of the models were subject to\nnoticeable variance due to one-off events impacting the data.\n",

Wide binary pairs (separations $>10^3$ AU) are\nparticularly intriguing because their low binding energies make it difficult\nfor the stars to stay gravitationally bound over extended timescales,and thus\nprobe the dynamics of binary formation and dissolution. Our previous SLoWPoKES\nI \\& II catalogs provided the largest and most complete sample of wide binary\npairs of low masses. Here we present an extension of these catalogs to a broad\nrange of stellar masses: the Gaia Assorted Mass Binaries Long Excluded from\nSloWPoKES (GAMBLES), comprising 8,660 statistically significant wide pairs that\nwe make available in a living online database. Within this catalog we identify\na subset of 543 long-lived (dissipation timescale $>$1.5 Gyr) candidate binary\npairs, of assorted mass, with typical separations between $10^3-10^{5.5}$ AU\n($0.002-1.5$ pc), using the published distances and proper motions from the\nTycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution and Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry. Each\npair has at most a false positive probability of 0.05; the total expectation is\n2.44 false binaries in our sample. Among these, we find 22 systems with 3\ncomponents, 1 system with 4 components, and 15 pairs consisting of at least 1\npossible red giant. We find the largest long-lived binary separation to be\nnearly 3.2 pc; even so, $>76\\%$ of GAMBLES long-lived binaries have large\nbinding energies and dissipation lifetimes longer than 1.5 Gyr. Finally, we\nfind the distribution of binary separations is clearly bimodal, corroborating\nthe finding from SloWPoKES and suggesting multiple pathways for the formation\nand dissipation of the widest binaries in the Galaxy.\n",

To evaluate\nbetter the forecaster's skill, it has been recently suggested to use a new\ncharacteristic, the gambling score R, which incorporates the difficulty of\nguessing each target event by using different weights for different alarms. We\nexpand the class of R-characteristics and apply these to the analysis of\nresults of the M8 prediction algorithm. We show that the level of significance\n'alfa' strongly depends (1) on the choice of weighting alarm parameters, (2) on\nthe partitioning of the entire alarm volume into component parts, and (3) on\nthe accuracy of the spatial rate of target events, m(dg). These tools are at\nthe disposal of the researcher and can affect the significance estimate in\neither direction. All the R-statistics discussed here corroborate that the\nprediction of 8.0<=M<8.5 events by the M8 method is nontrivial. However,\nconclusions based on traditional characteristics (n,tau) are more reliable\nowing to two circumstances: 'tau' is stable since it is based on relative\nvalues of m(.), and the 'n' statistic enables constructing an upper estimate of\n'alfa' taking into account the uncertainty of m(.).\n",

In a standard inferential problem with conditional events, it lets\nus determine the natural extension, as well as an upper extension. With\nconditional gambles, it is useful in deriving a number of inferential\ninequalities.\n",

Philosophically, they pertain to\nindividual or shared knowledge of facts, rather than to facts themselves, and\ntherefore can be interpreted as generalizing epistemic probability, that is,\nprobability theory interpreted epistemologically. Belief functions are more\nflexible and better suited to deal with certain types of uncertainty than\nclassical probability distributions. We develop a new calculus for belief\nfunctions which does not use the much criticized Dempster's rule of\ncombination, by generalizing the classical notions of conditioning and\nindependence in a natural and uncontroversial way. Using this calculus, we\nexplain our rejection of Dempster's rule in detail. We apply the new theory to\na number of examples, including a gambling example and an example in a forensic\nsetting.

        "summary": "  Quantum computers that process information by harnessing the remarkable power\nof quantum mechanics are increasingly being put to practical use. In the\nfuture, their impact will be felt in numerous fields, including in online\ncasino games. This is one of the reasons why quantum gambling theory has\ngarnered considerable attention. Studies have shown that the quantum gambling\ntheory often yields nontrivial consequences that classical theory cannot\ninterpret. We devised a quantum circuit reproducing classical blackjack and\nfound possible quantum entanglement between strategies. This circuit can be\nrealized in the near future when quantum computers are commonplace.\nFurthermore, we showed that the player's expectation increases compared to the\nclassical game using quantum basic strategy, which is a quantum version of the\npopular basic strategy of blackjack.\n",

        "summary": "  Aggregating risks from multiple sources can be complex and demanding, and\ndecision makers usually adopt heuristics to simplify the evaluation process.\nThis paper axiomatizes two closed related and yet different heuristics, narrow\nbracketing and correlation neglect, by relaxing the independence axiom in the\nexpected utility theory. The flexibility of our framework allows for\napplications in various economic problems. First, our model can explain the\nexperimental evidence of narrow bracketing over monetary gambles. Second, when\none source represents background risk, we can accommodate Rabin (2000)'s\ncritique and explain risk aversion over small gambles. Finally, when different\nsources represent consumptions in different periods, we unify three seemingly\ndistinct models of time preferences and propose a novel model that\nsimultaneously satisfies indifference to temporal resolution of uncertainty,\nseparation of time and risk preferences, and recursivity in the domain of\nlotteries. As a direct application to macroeconomics and finance, we provide an\nalternative to Epstein and Zin (1989) which avoids the unreasonably high timing\npremium discussed in Epstein, Farhi, and Strzalecki (2014).\n",

Its aim is to model a subject's beliefs about which things are\ndesirable. What the things are is not important, nor is what it means for them\nto be desirable. It can be applied to gambles, calling them desirable if a\nsubject accepts them, but it can just as well be applied to pizzas, calling\nthem desirable if my friend Arthur likes to eat them. Other useful examples of\nthings one might apply this theory to are propositions, horse lotteries, or\npreferences between any of the above. Regardless of the particular things that\nare considered, inference rules are imposed by means of an abstract closure\noperator, and models that adhere to these rules are called coherent. I consider\ntwo types of models, each of which can capture a subject's beliefs about which\nthings are desirable: sets of desirable things and sets of desirable sets of\nthings. A crucial result is that the latter type can be represented by a set of\nthe former.\n",

Specifically, we define\nparametric functions $ v_{\\theta} $, $ w^{-}_{\\theta} $, and $ w^{+}_{\\theta} $\nsatisfying three key properties. The first, \\emph{validity}, ensures that for\nany parameter $\\theta$, the functions conform to the qualitative principles of\nCPT: $ v_{\\theta} $ is concave over gains and convex over losses with a steeper\nslope for losses; $ w^{-}_{\\theta} $ and $ w^{+}_{\\theta} $ are increasing,\nexhibit inverse S-shaped curves, and map 0 to 0 and 1 to 1. The second,\n\\emph{richness}, guarantees that the parametrization is expressive enough to\ncapture a wide range of behaviors: $ v_{\\theta} $ can exhibit arbitrary\nasymptotic behavior and convergence rates, while $ w^{-}_{\\theta} $ and $\nw^{+}_{\\theta} $ can achieve any specified crossover points and slopes. The\nthird, \\emph{explicit valuation}, ensures that for any $\\theta$, the CPT\nvaluation of a Gaussian-distributed gamble (with arbitrary mean and variance)\ncan be computed in closed form -- enabling efficient approximations for\nbell-shaped reward distributions. This framework is designed for scalable and\nrapid computation, making it particularly suited for applications involving\nlarge populations. We demonstrate its practicality through two illustrative\nexamples in population-level CPT modeling.\n",

It is well known that asymptotic local\noperations and classical communication (LOCC) are required to get a simple\noperational measure of bipartite pure state entanglement. For bipartite mixed\nstates and multipartite pure states it is likely that a more powerful class of\noperations will be needed. To this end \\cite{BPRST01} have defined more\npowerful versions of state transformations (or reducibilities), namely LOCCq\n(asymptotic LOCC with a sublinear amount of quantum communication) and CLOCC\n(asymptotic LOCC with catalysis). In this paper we show that {\\em LOCCq state\ntransformations are only as powerful as asymptotic LOCC state transformations}\nfor multipartite pure states. We first generalize the concept of entanglement\ngambling from two parties to multiple parties: any pure multipartite entangled\nstate can be transformed to an EPR pair shared by some pair of parties and that\nany irreducible $m$ $(m\\ge 2)$ party pure state can be used to create any other\nstate (pure or mixed), using only local operations and classical communication\n(LOCC). We then use this tool to prove the result. We mention some applications\nof multipartite entanglement gambling to multipartite distillability and to\ncharacterizations of multipartite minimal entanglement generating sets. Finally\nwe discuss generalizations of this result to mixed states by defining the class\nof {\\em cat distillable states}.\n",

For example, in the online\nmax-cut problem, the comparison class is matrices which represent cuts of a\ngiven graph and in online gambling the comparison class is matrices which\nrepresent permutations over n teams. Another important example is online\ncollaborative filtering in which a widely used comparison class is the set of\nmatrices with a small trace norm. In this paper we isolate a property of\nmatrices, which we call (beta,tau)-decomposability, and derive an efficient\nonline learning algorithm, that enjoys a regret bound of O*(sqrt(beta tau T))\nfor all problems in which the comparison class is composed of\n(beta,tau)-decomposable matrices. By analyzing the decomposability of cut\nmatrices, triangular matrices, and low trace-norm matrices, we derive near\noptimal regret bounds for online max-cut, online gambling, and online\ncollaborative filtering. In particular, this resolves (in the affirmative) an\nopen problem posed by Abernethy (2010); Kleinberg et al (2010). Finally, we\nderive lower bounds for the three problems and show that our upper bounds are\noptimal up to logarithmic factors.

Linear utility is\noptimal for additive dynamics, whereas logarithmic utility is optimal for\nmultiplicative dynamics. Whether humans approximate time optimal behavior\nacross different dynamics is unknown. Here we compare the effects of additive\nversus multiplicative gamble dynamics on risky choice. We show that utility\nfunctions are modulated by gamble dynamics in ways not explained by prevailing\ndecision theory. Instead, as predicted by time optimality, risk aversion\nincreases under multiplicative dynamics, distributing close to the values that\nmaximise the time average growth of wealth.

To do this, we need to compare the performance of competing\nmodels with each other in prospective forecasting mode, and to rank their\nperformance using a fair, reproducible and reliable method. The Collaboratory\nfor the Study of Earthquake Predictability (CSEP) conducts such prospective\nearthquake forecasting experiments around the globe. One metric that has been\nproposed to rank competing models is the Parimutuel Gambling score, which has\nthe advantage of allowing alarm-based (categorical) forecasts to be compared\nwith probabilistic ones. Here we examine the suitability of this score for\nranking competing earthquake forecasts. First, we prove analytically that this\nscore is in general improper, meaning that, on average, it does not prefer the\nmodel that generated the data. Even in the special case where it is proper, we\nshow it can still be used in an improper way. Then, we compare its performance\nwith two commonly-used proper scores (the Brier and logarithmic scores), taking\ninto account the uncertainty around the observed average score. We estimate the\nconfidence intervals for the expected score difference which allows us to\ndefine if and when a model can be preferred.

        "summary": "  Quantum computers are rapidly becoming more capable, with dramatic increases\nin both qubit count and quality. Among different hardware approaches,\ntrapped-ion quantum processors are a leading technology for quantum computing,\nwith established high-fidelity operations and architectures with promising\nscaling. Here, we demonstrate and thoroughly benchmark the IonQ Forte system:\nconfigured as a single-chain 30-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer with\nall-to-all operations. We assess the performance of our quantum computer\noperation at the component level via direct randomized benchmarking (DRB)\nacross all 30 choose 2 = 435 gate pairs. We then show the results of\napplication-oriented benchmarks and show that the system passes the suite of\nalgorithmic qubit (AQ) benchmarks up to #AQ 29. Finally, we use our\ncomponent-level benchmarking to build a system-level model to predict the\napplication benchmarking data through direct simulation. While we find that the\nsystem-level model correlates with the experiment in predicting application\ncircuit performance, we note quantitative discrepancies indicating significant\nout-of-model errors, leading to higher predicted performance than what is\nobserved. This highlights that as quantum computers move toward larger and\nhigher-quality devices, characterization becomes more challenging, suggesting\nfuture work required to push performance further.\n",

This is a retrospective study of 491 non-contrast head CTs\nfrom the CQ500 dataset, in which three senior radiologists annotated slices\ncontaining intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The dataset was split into definite\nand challenging subsets, where challenging images were defined to those in\nwhich there was disagreement among readers. A DL model was trained on 146\npatients (10,815 slices) from the definite data (training dataset) to perform\nICH localization and classification for five classes of ICH. To develop an\nuncertainty-aware DL model, 1,546 cases of the definite data (calibration\ndataset) was used for Mondrian conformal prediction (MCP). The\nuncertainty-aware DL model was tested on 8,401 definite and challenging cases\nto assess its ability to identify challenging cases. After the MCP procedure,\nthe model achieved an F1 score of 0.920 for ICH classification on the test\ndataset. Additionally, it correctly identified 6,837 of the 6,856 total\nchallenging cases as challenging (99.7% accuracy). It did not incorrectly label\nany definite cases as challenging. The uncertainty-aware ICH detector performs\non par with state-of-the-art models. MCP's performance in detecting challenging\ncases demonstrates that it is useful in automated ICH detection and promising\nfor trustworthiness in radiological DL.\n",

        "summary": "  We show in a simulation when economic agents are subject to evolution (random\nchange and selection based on the success in the estimation of the result of\nthe gamble) they acquire risk aversive behavior. This behavior appears in the\nform of adjustment of their estimation of probabilities when calculating the\nexpected value (ensemble average). It means that their subjective probabilities\nevolve in such a way that economic agents tend to assign lower probabilities to\n\"good\" events and higher probabilities to \"bad\" events. These subjective\nprobabilities can be derived analytically by assuming that economic agents care\nabout time average, not the ensemble average. Probabilities calculated based on\nthis assumption are equal to the probabilities we get in evolutionary\nsimulation. Furthermore, it appears that these subjective probabilities are\nequal to risk-neutral probabilities in mathematical finance. Hence, by taking\ninto account that the environment in which economic agents operate is\nnon-ergodic, we are able to calculate risk-neutral probabilities that are\nconsistent with modern finance theory but are derived in a conceptually\ndifferent way. It means that when we assume that agents try to predict time\naverage, not ensemble average, the need for the concept of risk aversion\ndisappears, since there is no distortion of subjective probabilities.\nEvolutionary simulations are quite a general method that can be applied for the\ndetermination of relevant measures of the outcome of a gamble under various\nconditions.\n",

        "summary": "  The notion of a normal bit sequence was introduced by Borel in 1909; it was\nthe first definition of an individual random object. Normality is a weak notion\nof randomness requiring only that all $2^n$ factors (substrings) of arbitrary\nlength~$n$ appear with the same limit frequency $2^{-n}$. Later many stronger\ndefinitions of randomness were introduced, and in this context normality found\nits place as ``randomness against a finite-memory adversary''. A quantitative\nmeasure of finite-state compressibility was also introduced (the finite-state\ndimension) and normality means that the finite state dimension is maximal\n(equals~$1$).\n  Recently Nandakumar, Pulari and S (2023) introduced the notion of relative\nfinite-state dimension for a binary sequence with respect to some other binary\nsequence (treated as an oracle), and the corresponding notion of conditional\n(relative) normality. (Different notions of conditional randomness were\nconsidered before, but not for the finite memory case.) They establish\nequivalence between the block frequency and the gambling approaches to\nconditional normality and finite-state dimensions.\n  In this note we revisit their definitions and explain how this equivalence\ncan be obtained easily by generalizing known characterizations of\n(unconditional) normality and dimension in terms of compressibility\n(finite-state complexity), superadditive complexity measures and gambling\n(finite-state gales), thus also answering some questions left open in the\nabove-mentioned paper.\n",

Herein, we present a\ncomprehensive study on how DG and its game influence the dynamics of wearables\nand in-world visits in Decentraland. To this end, we analyzed 5.9 million\nwearable transfers made on the Polygon blockchain (and related sales) over a\ntwo-year period, and 677 million log events of in-world user positions in an\noverlapping 10-month period. We found that these activities are\ndisproportionately related to DG, with its ICE Poker casinos (less than 0.1% of\nthe world map) representing a remarkable average share of daily unique visitors\n(33%) and time spent in the virtual world (20%). Despite several alternative\ninitiatives within Decentraland, ICE Poker appears to drive user activity on\nthe platform.

(1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of\nPoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary.

Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that\ntokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23%\nlong Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are\neither porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation\nmethod on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile.

Mater. 13, 605 (2014)]. Here, we show that\nmulti-valley effective mass theory, applied properly, does achieve close\nagreement with tight-binding and hence gives reliable predictions. To\ndemonstrate this, we variationally solve the coupled six-valley Shindo-Nara\nequations, including silicon's full Bloch functions. Surprisingly, we find that\nincluding the full Bloch functions necessitates a tetrahedral, rather than\nspherical, donor central cell correction to accurately reproduce the\nexperimental energy spectrum of a phosphorus impurity in silicon. We\ncross-validate this method against atomistic tight-binding calculations,\nshowing that the two theories agree well for the calculation of donor-donor\ntunnel coupling. Further, we benchmark our results by performing a statistical\nuncertainty analysis, confirming that derived quantities such as the wave\nfunction profile and tunnel couplings are robust with respect to variational\nenergy fluctuations. Finally, we apply this method to exhaustively enumerate\nthe tunnel coupling for all donor-donor configurations within a large search\nvolume, demonstrating conclusively that the tunnel coupling has no spatially\nstable regions. Though this instability is problematic for reliably coupling\ndonor pairs for two-qubit operations, we identify specific target locations\nwhere donor qubits can be placed with scanning tunneling microscopy technology\nto achieve reliably large tunnel couplings.\n",

        "summary": "  Optimal control models have been successful in describing many aspects of\nhuman movement. The interpretation of such models regarding neuronal\nimplementation of the human motor system is not clear. An important aspects of\noptimal control policies is the notion of cost. Optimal control seeks to\nminimize a notion of cost, while meeting certain goals. We offer a method to\ntransform current methods in the literature from their traditional form by\nchanging the norm by which cost is assessed. We show how sparsity can be\nintroduced into current optimal approaches that use continuous control signals.\nWe assess cost using the infinity norm. This results in optimal signals which\ncan be represented by a small amount of Dirac delta functions. Sparsity has\nplayed an important role in theoretical neuroscience for information processing\n(such as vision). In this work, to obtain sparse control signals, the infinity\nnorm is used as a penalty on the control signal, which is then encoded with\nDirac delta functions. We show, for a basic physical system, a point mass can\nbe moved between two points in a way that resembles human fast reaching\nmovements. Despite the sparse nature of the control signal, the movements that\nresult are continuous and smooth. These control signals are simpler than their\nnon-sparse counterparts, yet yield comparable results when applied towards\nmodeling reaching movements. In addition, such sparse control signals resemble\na sequence of spikes, giving this approach a biological interpretation. Actual\nneuronal implementations are more complex. However, this work shows, in\nprinciple, that sparsely encoded control signals are a plausible implementation\nfor the control of reaching movements. Leading techniques for modeling human\nmovements can easily be adjusted in order to introduce sparsity, with a\nbiological interpretation and the simplified information content of the control\nsignal.\n",

The operational, game- based interpretation aids the intuition\nand continues in the more general context to provide a surprisingly practical\nspecification tool.\n  A corollary of our proofs is an extension of Everett's singly-nested games\nresult in the finite turn-based case: we prove well-definedness of the minimax\nvalue, and existence of fixed memoriless strategies, for all qMu\ngames/formulae, of arbitrary (including alternating) nesting structure.\n",

The\nenergy of spin-resolved Kondo peaks is proportional to magnetic field at high\nfields, contrary to recent reports. At lower fields, the energy falls below\nthis linear dependence, in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations.\nFor even electron occupancy, we observe a spin-1 Kondo effect due to the\ndegeneracy of the triplet ground states. Tuning gate voltage within the same\nCoulomb diamond drives a transition to a singlet ground state. We also\nindependently tune the energy difference between singlet and triplet states\nwith a magnetic field. The Zeeman splitting thus measured confirms the value of\nthe g-factor measured from the spin-1/2 Kondo feature.\n",

Unlike the conventional expected utility maximization model, such\na behavioral model could be easily mis-formulated (a.k.a. ill-posed) if its\ndifferent components do not coordinate well with each other. Certain classes of\nan ill-posed model are identified. A systematic approach, which is\nfundamentally different from the ones employed for the utility model, is\ndeveloped to solve a well-posed model, assuming a complete market and general\nIt\\^o processes for asset prices. The optimal terminal wealth positions,\nderived in fairly explicit forms, possess surprisingly simple structure\nreminiscent of a gambling policy betting on a good state of the world while\naccepting a fixed, known loss in case of a bad one. An example with a two-piece\nCRRA utility is presented to illustrate the general results obtained, and is\nsolved completely for all admissible parameters. The effect of the behavioral\ncriterion on the risky allocations is finally discussed.\n",

        "summary": "  In the National Basketball Association (NBA), teams must make choices about\nwhich players to acquire, how much to pay them, and other decisions that are\nfundamentally dependent on player effectiveness. Thus, there is great interest\nin quantitatively understanding the impact of each player. In this paper we\ndevelop a new penalized regression model for the NBA, use cross-validation to\nselect its tuning parameters, and then use it to produce ratings of player\nability. We then apply the model to the 2010-2011 NBA season to predict the\noutcome of games. We compare the performance of our procedure to other known\nregression techniques for this problem, and demonstrate empirically that our\nmodel produces substantially better predictions. We evaluate the performance of\nour procedure against the Las Vegas gambling lines, and show that with a\nsufficiently large number of games to train on our model outperforms those\nlines. Finally, we demonstrate how the technique developed in this paper can be\nused to quantitively identify \"overrated\" players who are less impactful than\ncommon wisdom might suggest.\n",

Statistical tests are thus not sufficient to guarantee that an RNG\nis usable for applications, e.g., in cryptography or gambling, where\nunpredictability is important. To enable such applications a stronger notion of\nrandomness, termed \"true randomness\", is required, which includes independence\nfrom prior information.\n  Quantum systems are particularly suitable for true randomness generation, as\ntheir unpredictability can be proved based on physical principles. Practical\nimplementations of Quantum RNGs (QRNGs) are however always subject to noise,\ni.e., influences which are not fully controlled. This reduces the quality of\nthe raw randomness generated by the device, making it necessary to post-process\nit. Here we provide a framework to analyse realistic QRNGs and to determine the\npost-processing that is necessary to turn their raw output into true\nrandomness.\n",

Both these issues can be addressed by a single mechanism for\ncreating abstractions over provenance, coupled with a policy model to drive the\nabstraction.

        "summary": "  In economics and psychology, delay discounting is often used to characterize\nhow individuals choose between a smaller immediate reward and a larger delayed\nreward. People with higher delay discounting rate (DDR) often choose smaller\nbut more immediate rewards (a \"today person\"). In contrast, people with a lower\ndiscounting rate often choose a larger future rewards (a \"tomorrow person\").\nSince the ability to modulate the desire of immediate gratification for long\nterm rewards plays an important role in our decision-making, the lower\ndiscounting rate often predicts better social, academic and health outcomes. In\ncontrast, the higher discounting rate is often associated with problematic\nbehaviors such as alcohol/drug abuse, pathological gambling and credit card\ndefault. Thus, research on understanding and moderating delay discounting has\nthe potential to produce substantial societal benefits.\n",

What makes this challenging is that the\noutcome of an event can be influenced by many factors that dynamically change\nacross time. Oddsmakers attempt to estimate these factors by using both\nalgorithmic and subjective methods to set the spread. However, it is well-known\nthat both human and algorithmic decision-making can be biased, so this paper\nexplores if oddsmaker biases can be used in an exploitative manner, in order to\nimprove the prediction of NFL game outcomes. Real-world gambling data was used\nto train and test different predictive models under varying assumptions. The\nresults show that methods that leverage oddsmaker biases in an exploitative\nmanner perform best under the conditions tested in this paper. These findings\nsuggest that leveraging human and algorithmic decision biases in an\nexploitative manner may be useful for predicting the outcomes of competitive\nevents, and could lead to increased profit for those who have financial\ninterest in the outcomes.\n",

This contrasts with the dominant behavioural model in economics,\nexpected utility theory, in which agents maximise expectation values of changes\nin psychologically transformed wealth. Historically, growth optimality was\nexplored for additive and multiplicative gambles. Here we apply it to a general\nclass of wealth dynamics, extending the range of economic situations where it\nmay be used. Moreover, we show a correspondence between growth optimality and\nexpected utility theory, in which the ergodicity transformation in the former\nis identified as the utility function in the latter. This correspondence offers\na theoretical basis for choosing utility functions and predicts that wealth\ndynamics are strong determinants of risk preferences.\n",

In this paper, we rethink adversarial training for\nsemantic segmentation and propose to formulate the fake/real discrimination\nframework with a correct/incorrect training objective. More specifically, we\nreplace the discriminator with a \"gambler\" network that learns to spot and\ndistribute its budget in areas where the predictions are clearly wrong, while\nthe segmenter network tries to leave no clear clues for the gambler where to\nbet. Empirical evaluation on two road-scene semantic segmentation tasks shows\nthat not only does the proposed method re-enable expressing uncertainties, it\nalso improves pixel-wise and structure-based metrics.\n",

The problem of optimally designing physical\nexperiment, using a computer model, is similar to the problem of finding\noptimal design for fitting nonlinear models. However, the problem is more\nchallenging than the existing work on nonlinear optimal design because of the\npossibility of model discrepancy, that is, the computer model may not be an\naccurate representation of the true underlying model. Therefore, we propose an\noptimal design approach that is robust to potential model discrepancies. We\nshow that our designs are better than the commonly used physical experimental\ndesigns that do not make use of the information contained in the computer model\nand other nonlinear optimal designs that ignore potential model discrepancies.\nWe illustrate our approach using a toy example and a real example from\nindustry.\n",

        "summary": "  Gate set tomography (GST) is a protocol for detailed, predictive\ncharacterization of logic operations (gates) on quantum computing processors.\nEarly versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been\nrefined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper\npresents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important\nfeature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is\nthat it is calibration-free. GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state\npreparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in\na gate set simultaneously and self-consistently, relative to each other. Long\nsequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency,\nachieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper,\nwe cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to\nachieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error\nbars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets. Our focus\nis fundamental mathematical aspects of GST, rather than implementation details,\nbut we touch on some of the foundational algorithmic tricks used in the pyGSTi\nimplementation.\n",

At the core of\ndesirability lies an assumption of linearity of the scale in which rewards are\nmeasured. It is a traditional assumption used to derive the expected utility\nmodel, which clashes with a general representation of rational decision making,\nthough. Allais has, in particular, pointed this out in 1953 with his famous\nparadox. We note that the utility scale plays the role of a closure operator\nwhen we regard desirability as a logical theory. This observation enables us to\nextend desirability to the nonlinear case by letting the utility scale be\nrepresented via a general closure operator. The new theory directly expresses\nrewards in actual nonlinear currency (money), much in Savage's spirit, while\narguably weakening the founding assumptions to a minimum. We characterise the\nmain properties of the new theory both from the perspective of sets of gambles\nand of their lower and upper prices (previsions).

In\nthis study, we design a lottery that maximizes the seller's profit when the\nbuyers follow CPT. The derived problem is nonconvex and constrained, and hence,\nit is challenging to directly characterize its optimal solution. We overcome\nthis difficulty by reformulating the problem as a three-level optimization\nproblem. The reformulation enables us to characterize the optimal solution.\nBased on this characterization, we propose an algorithm that computes the\noptimal lottery in linear time with respect to the number of lottery tickets.\nIn addition, we provide an efficient algorithm for a more general setting in\nwhich the ticket price is constrained. To the best of the authors' knowledge,\nthis is the first study that employs the CPT framework for designing an optimal\nlottery.\n",

Random numbers are often used to generate keys for data encryption.\nRandom numbers generated at a sufficiently long length can encrypt sensitive\ndata and make it difficult for another computer or person to decrypt the data.\nOther uses for random numbers include statistical sampling, search/sort\nalgorithms, gaming, and gambling.

And consumption can only be withdrawn from the bequest\naccount. Each transaction between the two accounts incurs fixed and\nproportional transaction costs depending on the transaction volume. The retiree\ndynamically controls the allocation policy between the two accounts and the\nconsumption policy to maximize the consumption and bequest utilities. We\nformulate the optimization problem as a combined stochastic and impulse control\nproblem with infinite time horizon, and characterize the value function as the\nunique viscosity solution of a HJBQVI (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmen\nquasi-variational inequality). The numerical results exhibit the V-shaped\ntransaction region which consists of two stages. In the former stage, since\nlongevity credits increase gradually, the retiree decreases the proportion of\nwealth in the tontine account to smooth the wealth and reduce the volatility.\nHowever, in the latter stage, the retiree increases the proportion of wealth in\nthe tontine account to gamble for the considerable longevity credits.\n",

The classical\nexpectation operator is replaced by a pair of subadditive operators one of them\nproviding a class of null sets and the other one acting as an outer integral.\nThese operators are motivated by a financial theory of no-arbitrage pricing.\nSuch a setting extends the classical stochastic framework by replacing the path\nspace of the process by a trajectory set, while also providing a\nfinancial/gambling interpretation based on the notion of superhedging. The\npaper proves analogues of the following classical results: Doob's\nsupermartingale decomposition and Doob's pointwise convergence theorem for\nnonnegative supermartingales. The approach shows how linearity of the\nexpectation operator can be circumvented and how integrability properties in\nthe proposed setting lead to the special case of (hedging) martingales while no\nintegrability conditions are required for the general supermartingale case.\n",

Our algorithmic contribution is to introduce online learning methods\nfor price-setting. Traditionally bookmakers update their prices rather\ninfrequently, we present two algorithms that guide price updates upon seeing\neach bet, assuming very little of bettor belief distributions. The online\npricing algorithm achieves stochastic regret of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ against\nthe worst local maximum, or $ \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log T}) $ with high\nprobability against the global maximum under fair odds.

We want to test $H_0:\\theta = 0$ (no control) versus\n$H_1:\\theta > 0$ (some control).

        "summary": "  This study presents a rigorous mathematical approach to the optimization of\nround and betting policies in Blackjack, using Markov Decision Processes (MDP)\nand Expected Utility Theory. The analysis considers a direct confrontation\nbetween a player and the dealer, simplifying the dynamics of the game. The\nobjective is to develop optimal strategies that maximize expected utility for\nrisk profiles defined by constant (CRRA) and absolute (CARA) aversion utility\nfunctions. Dynamic programming algorithms are implemented to estimate optimal\ngambling and betting policies with different levels of complexity. The\nevaluation is performed through simulations, analyzing histograms of final\nreturns. The results indicate that the advantage of applying optimized round\npolicies over the \"basic strategy\" is slight, highlighting the efficiency of\nthe last one. In addition, betting strategies based on the exact composition of\nthe deck slightly outperform the Hi-Lo counting system, showing its\neffectiveness. The optimized strategies include versions suitable for mental\nuse in physical environments and more complex ones requiring computational\nprocessing. Although the computed strategies approximate the theoretical\noptimal performance, this study is limited to a specific configuration of\nrules. As a future challenge, it is proposed to explore strategies under other\ngame configurations, considering additional players or deeper penetration of\nthe deck, which could pose new technical challenges.\n",

We\nsubsequently show that an increased expressivity in the initialization\npotentially accelerates model convergence and improves generalization.

To solve it,\nwe employ the Successive Elimination algorithm, which adaptively allocates\nmeasurements and discards unpromising candidates early.

The theory, like its classical\ncounterpart, consists of an algebra of events, and the probability measures\ndefined on it. The construction proceeds in the following steps: (a) Axioms for\nthe algebra of events are introduced following Birkhoff and von Neumann. All\naxioms, except the one that expresses the uncertainty principle, are shared\nwith the classical event space. The only models for the set of axioms are\nlattices of subspaces of inner product spaces over a field K. (b) Another axiom\ndue to Soler forces K to be the field of real, or complex numbers, or the\nquaternions. We suggest a probabilistic reading of Soler's axiom. (c) Gleason's\ntheorem fully characterizes the probability measures on the algebra of events,\nso that Born's rule is derived. (d) Gleason's theorem is equivalent to the\nexistence of a certain finite set of rays, with a particular orthogonality\ngraph (Wondergraph). Consequently, all aspects of quantum probability can be\nderived from rational probability assignments to finite \"quantum gambles\". We\napply the approach to the analysis of entanglement, Bell inequalities, and the\nquantum theory of macroscopic objects. We also discuss the relation of the\npresent approach to quantum logic, realism and truth, and the measurement\nproblem.\n",

Beyond conceptual issues, work at Perimeter\nInstitute is focused on the hard technical problem of finding a good\nrepresentation of quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities, without\namplitudes or Hilbert-space operators. The best candidate representation\ninvolves a mysterious entity called a symmetric informationally complete\nquantum measurement. Contemplation of it gives a way of thinking of the Born\nRule as an addition to the rules of probability theory, applicable when an\nagent considers gambling on the consequences of his interactions with a newly\nrecognized universal capacity: dimension (formerly Hilbert-space dimension).\n(The word \"capacity\" should conjure up an image of something like gravitational\nmass---a body's mass measures its capacity to attract other bodies.

It is based upon the works of\nthis author but particularly on his \"Manuel du sp\\'eculateur \\`a la Bourse\"\n(Stock Market Speculator Manual) edited in 1857 in Paris. Compared to the\nmarkets of today, however, the stock market described by Proudhon appears\nembryonic. Nevertheless it represents the location for transactions in\nfinancial assets, commodities, precious metals and even some transactions\ninvolving options. This contribution is organised in the following manner - the\nfirst section is devoted to the development of Proudhon's thought in relation\nto speculation. It is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon's definitions of stock market speculation or gambling\nwith shares that for him served no purpose either from a human or economic\nperspective and was therefore condemnable and to be contrasted with\nentrepreneurial speculation that, even though it is a highly-risky activity,\ninvolves the spirit of enterprise and provides the lifeblood of economic\ngrowth. The second part allows us to present Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's\npropositions in relation to restricting the speculation that he considers\nobnoxious. The second section has two objectives: one part places in\nperspective the views of Proudhon and the characteristics of stock market\nactivity under the Second Empire whilst the other part examines current-day\naspects of the characteristics evoked by Proudhon. We are interested especially\nin the question of the regulation and that of the relevance today of certain\naccounting practices.\n",

We\nfocus on quantum random walks of multiple non-interacting particles on strongly\nregular graphs (SRGs), a class of graphs with high symmetry that is known to\nhave pairs of graphs that are hard to distinguish. Previous work has already\ndemonstrated analytically that two-particle non-interacting quantum walks\ncannot distinguish non-isomorphic SRGs of the same family. Here, we demonstrate\nnumerically that three-particle non-interacting quantum walks have significant,\nbut not universal, distinguishing power for pairs of SRGs, proving a\nfundamental difference between the distinguishing power of two-particle and\nthree-particle non-interacting walks. We analytically show why this\ndistinguishing power is possible, whereas it is forbidden for two-particle\nnon-interacting walks. Based on sampling of SRGs with up to 64 vertices, we\nfind no difference in the distinguishing power of bosonic and fermionic walks.\nIn addition, we find that the four-fermion non-interacting walk has greater\ndistinguishing power than the three-particle walks on SRGs, showing that\nincreasing particle number increases distinguishing power. However, we also\nanalytically show that no non-interacting walk with a fixed number of particles\ncan distinguish all SRGs, thus demonstrating a potential fundamental difference\nbetween the distinguishing power of interacting and noninteracting walks.\n",

Qualitative\nresearch in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science suggests that\nthis choice is shaped by an \"essential tension\" between the professional demand\nfor productivity and a conflicting drive toward risky innovation. We examine\nthis tension empirically in the context of biomedical chemistry. We use complex\nnetworks to represent the evolving state of scientific knowledge, as expressed\nin publications. We then define research strategies relative to these networks.\nScientists can introduce novel chemicals or chemical relationships--or delve\ndeeper into known ones. They can consolidate existing knowledge clusters, or\nbridge distant ones. Analyzing such choices in aggregate, we find that the\ndistribution of strategies remains remarkably stable, even as chemical\nknowledge grows dramatically. High-risk strategies, which explore new chemical\nrelationships, are less prevalent in the literature, reflecting a growing focus\non established knowledge at the expense of new opportunities. Research\nfollowing a risky strategy is more likely to be ignored but also more likely to\nachieve high impact and recognition. While the outcome of a risky strategy has\na higher expected reward than the outcome of a conservative strategy, the\nadditional reward is insufficient to compensate for the additional risk. By\nstudying the winners of 137 different prizes in biomedicine and chemistry, we\nshow that the occasional \"gamble\" for extraordinary impact is the most\nplausible explanation for observed levels of risk-taking. Our empirical\ndemonstration and unpacking of the \"essential tension\" suggests policy\ninterventions that may foster more innovative research.\n",

The presence of the third\nelectron enables very fast rotations to all possible states, in contrast to the\ncase when only two electrons are used, in which some rotations are slow. The\nminimum oscillation frequency we observe is >5 GHz.\n",

        "summary": "  A decision maker observes the evolving state of the world while constantly\ntrying to predict the next state given the history of past states. The ability\nto benefit from such predictions depends not only on the ability to recognize\npatters in history, but also on the range of actions available to the decision\nmaker.\n  We assume there are two possible states of the world. The decision maker is a\ngambler who has to bet a certain amount of money on the bits of an announced\nbinary sequence of states. If he makes a correct prediction he wins his wager,\notherwise he loses it.\n  We compare the power of betting strategies (aka martingales) whose wagers\ntake values in different sets of reals. A martingale whose wagers take values\nin a set $A$ is called an $A$-martingale. A set of reals $B$ anticipates a set\n$A$, if for every $A$-martingale there is a countable set of $B$-martingales,\nsuch that on every binary sequence on which the $A$-martingale gains an\ninfinite amount at least one of the $B$-martingales gains an infinite amount,\ntoo.\n  We show that for two important classes of pairs of sets $A$ and $B$, $B$\nanticipates $A$ if and only if the closure of $B$ contains $rA$, for some\npositive $r$. One class is when $A$ is bounded and $B$ is bounded away from\nzero; the other class is when $B$ is well ordered (has no left-accumulation\npoints). Our results generalize several recent results in algorithmic\nrandomness and answer a question posed by Chalcraft et al. (2012).\n",

The winner of the contest is the agent who\nstops at the highest value. The model assumes that all the processes start from\na common value $x_0>0$ and the symmetric Nash equilibrium is for each agent to\nutilise a stopping rule which yields a randomised value for the stopped\nprocess. In the two-player contest, this randomised value has a uniform\ndistribution on $[0,2x_0]$. In this paper, we consider a variant of the problem\nwhereby the starting values of the Brownian motions are independent,\nnonnegative random variables that have a common law $\\mu$. We consider a\ntwo-player contest and prove the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric Nash\nequilibrium for the problem. The solution is that each agent should aim for the\ntarget law $\\nu$, where $\\nu$ is greater than or equal to $\\mu$ in convex\norder; $\\nu$ has an atom at zero of the same size as any atom of $\\mu$ at zero,\nand otherwise is atom free; on $(0,\\infty)$ $\\nu$ has a decreasing density; and\nthe density of $\\nu$ only decreases at points where the convex order constraint\nis binding.\n",

Our aim here is to examine some of the popular \"average\" assumptions in\na more realistic setting of a stochastic model. Thus, we examine the contention\nthat investment in the stock market is similar to gambling in a casino, while\npurchasing companies, after due diligence, is safer under the premise that\nacting as a holding company that wholly owns other companies avoids some of the\nstock market risks. We show that the stock market index faithfully reflects its\ncompanies' profits at the time of their publication. We compare the shifted\nhistorical dynamics of the S\\&P500's aggregated financial earnings to its\nvalue, and find a high degree of correlation. We conclude that there is no\nbenefit to a pension fund in wholly owning a super trust. We verify, by\nexamining historical data, that stock earnings follow an exponential\n(geometric) Brownian motion and estimate its parameters. The robustness of this\nmodel is examined by an estimate of a pensioner's accumulated assets over a\nsaving period. We also estimate the survival probability and mean survival time\nof the accumulated individual fund with pension consumption over the residual\nlife of the pensioner.\n",

In principle, several variants of Poker can be identified,\nalthough all of them make use of money to make the challenge meaningful and,\nmoreover, can be played in two different formats: tournament and cash game. An\nimportant issue when dealing with Poker is its classification, i.e., as a\n`skill game' or as gambling. Nowadays, its classification still represents an\nopen question, having a long list of implications (e.g., legal and healthcare)\nthat vary from country to country. In this study, we analyze Poker challenges,\nconsidering the cash game format, in terms of thermodynamics systems. Notably,\nwe propose a framework to represent a cash game Poker challenge that, although\nbased on a simplified scenario, allows both to obtain useful information for\nrounders (i.e., Poker players), and to evaluate the role of Poker room in this\ncontext. Finally, starting from a model based on thermodynamics, we show the\nevolution of a Poker challenge, making a direct connection with the probability\ntheory underlying its dynamics and finding that, even if we consider these\ngames as `skill games', to take a real profit from Poker is really hard.\n",

In this work, we demonstrate the coherent interaction\nof a $^{31}$P donor electron with the electron of a metal-oxide-semiconductor\nquantum dot. We form a logical qubit encoded in the spin singlet and triplet\nstates of the two-electron system. We show that the donor nuclear spin drives\ncoherent rotations between the electronic qubit states through the contact\nhyperfine interaction. This provides every key element for compact two-electron\nspin qubits requiring only a single dot and no additional magnetic field\ngradients, as well as a means to interact with the nuclear spin qubit.\n",

Effects on transport threshold, such as metal-insulator-transition\nand lateral confinement are non-negligible and included.

        "summary": "  Without Niels Bohr, QBism would be nothing. But QBism is not Bohr. This paper\nattempts to show that, despite a popular misconception, QBism is no minor tweak\nto Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is something quite distinct.\nAlong the way, we lay out three tenets of QBism in some detail: 1) The Born\nRule---the foundation of what quantum theory means for QBism---is a normative\nstatement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should\nstrive for; it is not a descriptive \"law of nature\" in the usual sense. 2) All\nprobabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they\nnever tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum\nstates thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world. 3) Quantum measurement outcomes\njust are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Particularly,\nquantum measurement outcomes are not, to paraphrase Bohr, instances of\n\"irreversible amplification in devices whose design is communicable in common\nlanguage suitably refined by the terminology of classical physics.\" Finally, an\nexplicit comparison is given between QBism and Bohr with regard to three\nsubjects: a) The issue of the \"detached observer\" as it arose in a debate\nbetween Pauli and Bohr, b) Bohr's reply to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, and\nc) Bohr's mature notion of \"quantum phenomena.\" At the end, we discuss how\nBohr's notion of phenomena may have something to offer the philosophy of\nWilliam James: A physics from which to further develop his vision of the\nworld---call it an ontology if you will---in which \"new being comes in local\nspots and patches.\"\n",

This\ndataset will promote speech and signal processing research of speech recorded\nby far-field microphones in noisy room conditions.

A\ntypical approach to better represent realistic scenarios, is to convolve clean\nspeech with noise and simulated room response for model training. Despite these\nefforts, model performance degrades when tested against uncurated speech in\nnatural conditions. For this corpus, audio was recorded in furnished rooms with\nbackground noise played in conjunction with foreground speech selected from the\nLibriSpeech corpus. Multiple sessions were recorded in each room to accommodate\nfor all foreground speech-background noise combinations. Audio was recorded\nusing twelve microphones placed throughout the room, resulting in 120 hours of\naudio per microphone.

Our approach is inspired by the\nrecent success of neural network models separating speakers from other speakers\nand singers from instrumental accompaniment. Unlike prior art, we leverage\nembedding spaces produced with source-contrastive estimation, a technique\nderived from negative sampling techniques in natural language processing, while\nsimultaneously obtaining a continuous inference mask. Our embedding space\ndirectly optimizes for the discrimination of speaker and noise by jointly\nmodeling their characteristics. This space is generalizable in that it is not\nspeaker or noise specific and is capable of denoising speech even if the model\nhas not seen the speaker in the training set. Parameters are trained with dual\nobjectives: one that promotes a selective bandpass filter that eliminates noise\nat time-frequency positions that exceed signal power, and another that\nproportionally splits time-frequency content between signal and noise. We\ncompare to state of the art algorithms as well as traditional sparse\nnon-negative matrix factorization solutions. The resulting algorithm avoids\nsevere computational burden by providing a more intuitive and easily optimized\napproach, while achieving competitive accuracy.\n",

        "summary": "  Goal: Limited-channel EEG research in neonates is hindered by lack of open,\naccessible analytic tools. To overcome this limitation, we have created the\nWashington University- Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two\nof the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source,\nclinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first\nalgorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by\nfiltering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with\nsubsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge\nfrequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-\ndefined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was\nvalidated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings\nof fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a\nreference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard\nmethodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification.\nInter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made\nusing the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the\nWU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater\nreliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the mean (SD) Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96 (0.04). Conclusion: We have\ndemonstrated a clinically-validated toolbox for generating the aEEG as well as\ncalculating the SEF from EEG data. Open-source access will enable widespread\nuse of common analytic algorithms which are device-independent and not subject\nto obsolescence, thereby facilitating future collaborative research in neonatal\nEEG.\n",

In\nsemiconductor quantum dot qubits, this manipulation requires controlling the\ndot orbital energies, tunnel couplings, and the electron occupations. These\nproperties all depend on the voltages placed on the metallic electrodes that\ndefine the device, whose positions are fixed once the device is fabricated.\nWhile there has been much success with small numbers of dots, as the number of\ndots grows, it will be increasingly useful to control these systems with as few\nelectrode voltage changes as possible. Here, we introduce a protocol, which we\ncall the Compressed Optimization of Device Architectures (CODA), in order to\nboth efficiently identify sparse sets of voltage changes that control quantum\nsystems, and to introduce a metric which can be used to compare device designs.\nAs an example of the former, we apply this method to simulated devices with up\nto 100 quantum dots and show that CODA automatically tunes devices more\nefficiently than other common nonlinear optimizers. To demonstrate the latter,\nwe determine the optimal lateral scale for a triple quantum dot, yielding a\nsimulated device that can be tuned with small voltage changes on a limited\nnumber of electrodes.\n",

        "summary": "  The principle that rational agents should maximize expected utility or\nchoiceworthiness is intuitively plausible in many ordinary cases of\ndecision-making under uncertainty. But it is less plausible in cases of\nextreme, low-probability risk (like Pascal's Mugging), and intolerably\nparadoxical in cases like the St. Petersburg and Pasadena games. In this paper\nI show that, under certain conditions, stochastic dominance reasoning can\ncapture most of the plausible implications of expectational reasoning while\navoiding most of its pitfalls. Specifically, given sufficient background\nuncertainty about the choiceworthiness of one's options, many\nexpectation-maximizing gambles that do not stochastically dominate their\nalternatives \"in a vacuum\" become stochastically dominant in virtue of that\nbackground uncertainty. But, even under these conditions, stochastic dominance\nwill not require agents to accept options whose expectational superiority\ndepends on sufficiently small probabilities of extreme payoffs. The sort of\nbackground uncertainty on which these results depend looks unavoidable for any\nagent who measures the choiceworthiness of her options in part by the total\namount of value in the resulting world. At least for such agents, then,\nstochastic dominance offers a plausible general principle of choice under\nuncertainty that can explain more of the apparent rational constraints on such\nchoices than has previously been recognized.\n",

Assume that two players hold certain amounts of money. At\neach stage of the game they simultaneously bid some part of their current\nfortune and the probability of winning or loosing depends on their bids. In\nmany models of the red-and-black game it is assumed that the win probability is\na function of the quotient of the bid of the first player and the sum of both\nbids. In the literature some additional properties, like concavity or\nsuper-multiplicativity are assumed in order to ensure that bold and timid\nstrategy is the Nash equilibrium. Our aim is to provide a generalization in\nwhich the probability of winning is a two-variable function which depends on\nboth bids. We introduce two new functional inequalities whose solutions lead to\nwin probability functions for which a Nash equilibrium is realized by the\nbold-timid strategy.

However, the number of derivatives that must\nbe simultaneously set to zero grows exponentially with the number of coupled\nqubits, making the task untenable for as few as two qubits. This is a\nparticular problem for adiabatic gates, due to their slower speeds. Here, we\npropose an adiabatic two-qubit gate for quantum dot hybrid qubits, based on the\ntunable, electrostatic coupling between distinct charge configurations. We\nconfirm the absence of a conventional sweet spot, but show that controlled-Z\n(CZ) gates can nonetheless be optimized to have fidelities of $\\sim$99% for a\ntypical level of quasistatic charge noise ($\\sigma_\\varepsilon$$\\simeq$1\n$\\mu$eV). We then develop the concept of a dynamical sweet spot (DSS), for\nwhich the time-averaged energy derivatives are set to zero, and identify a\nsimple pulse sequence that achieves an approximate DSS for a CZ gate, with a\n5$\\times$ improvement in the fidelity.

We discuss a metal-dot implementation as well as a molecular\nimplementation of this QRNG. Basic quantum mechanical principles are used to\nstudy power dissipation and timing considerations for the generation of random\nbit strings.

As a proof of principle we apply the method to a clean in-situ\ngrown InAs(100)/Al interface, a system with a strong in-built band bending. Due\nto the high signal-to-noise ratio of the core level spectra the proposed\nmethodology can be used on previously inaccessible semiconductor-metal\ninterfaces and support targeted design of novel hybrid devices and form the\nfoundation for a interface parameter database for specified synthesis processes\nof semiconductor-metal systems.\n",

Given a source vertex s and a target vertex t in the\n$\\Theta$6-graph (resp. half-$\\Theta$6-graph), there exists a deterministic\nonline routing algorithm that finds a path from s to t whose length is at most\n2 st (resp. 2.89 st) which is optimal in the worst case [Bose et al., siam J.\non Computing, 44(6)]. We propose alternative, slightly simpler routing\nalgorithms that are optimal in the worst case and for which we provide an\nanalysis of the average routing ratio for the $\\Theta$6-graph and\nhalf-$\\Theta$6-graph defined on a Poisson point process. For the\n$\\Theta$6-graph, our online routing algorithm has an expected routing ratio of\n1.161 (when s and t random) and a maximum expected routing ratio of 1.22\n(maximum for fixed s and t where all other points are random), much better than\nthe worst-case routing ratio of 2. For the half-$\\Theta$6-graph, our memoryless\nonline routing algorithm has an expected routing ratio of 1.43 and a maximum\nexpected routing ratio of 1.58. Our online routing algorithm that uses a\nconstant amount of additional memory has an expected routing ratio of 1.34 and\na maximum expected routing ratio of 1.40. The additional memory is only used to\nremember the coordinates of the starting point of the route.

        "summary": "  Conventional and current wisdom assumes that the brain represents probability\nas a continuous number to many decimal places. This assumption seems\nimplausible given finite and scarce resources in the brain. Quantization is an\ninformation encoding process whereby a continuous quantity is systematically\ndivided into a finite number of possible categories. Rounding is a simple\nexample of quantization. We apply this information theoretic concept to develop\na novel quantized (i.e., discrete) probability distortion function. We develop\nthree conjunction probability gambling tasks to look for evidence of quantized\nprobability representations in the brain. We hypothesize that certain ranges of\nprobability will be lumped together in the same indifferent category if a\nquantized representation exists. For example, two distinct probabilities such\nas 0.57 and 0.585 may be treated indifferently. Our extensive data analysis has\nfound strong evidence to support such a quantized representation: 59/76\nparticipants (i.e., 78%) demonstrated a best fit to 4-bit quantized models\ninstead of continuous models. This observation is the major development and\nnovelty of the present work. The brain is very likely to be employing a\nquantized representation of probability. This discovery demonstrates a major\nprecision limitation of the brain's representational and decision-making\nability.\n",

        "summary": "  The main purpose of this study is to introduce a semi-classical model\ndescribing betting scenarios in which, at variance with conventional\napproaches, the payoff of the gambler is encoded into the internal degrees of\nfreedom of a quantum memory element. In our scheme, we assume that the invested\ncapital is explicitly associated with the quantum analog of the free-energy\n(i.e. ergotropy functional by Allahverdyan, Balian, and Nieuwenhuizen) of a\nsingle mode of the electromagnetic radiation which, depending on the outcome of\nthe betting, experiences attenuation or amplification processes which model\nlosses and winning events. The resulting stochastic evolution of the quantum\nmemory resembles the dynamics of random lasing which we characterize within the\ntheoretical setting of Bosonic Gaussian channels. As in the classical Kelly\nCriterion for optimal betting, we define the asymptotic doubling rate of the\nmodel and identify the optimal gambling strategy for fixed odds and\nprobabilities of winning. The performance of the model are hence studied as a\nfunction of the input capital state under the assumption that the latter\nbelongs to the set of Gaussian density matrices (i.e. displaced, squeezed\nthermal Gibbs states) revealing that the best option for the gambler is to\ndevote all her/his initial resources into coherent state amplitude.\n",

However, human decision making in\nreal life usually involves different strategies and behavioral trajectories\nthat lead to the same empirical outcome. Motivated by clinical literature of a\nwide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, we propose here a more\ngeneral and flexible parametric framework for sequential decision making that\ninvolves a two-stream reward processing mechanism. We demonstrated that this\nframework is flexible and unified enough to incorporate a family of problems\nspanning multi-armed bandits (MAB), contextual bandits (CB) and reinforcement\nlearning (RL), which decompose the sequential decision making process in\ndifferent levels. Inspired by the known reward processing abnormalities of many\nmental disorders, our clinically-inspired agents demonstrated interesting\nbehavioral trajectories and comparable performance on simulated tasks with\nparticular reward distributions, a real-world dataset capturing human\ndecision-making in gambling tasks, and the PacMan game across different reward\nstationarities in a lifelong learning setting.\n",

However, these ground-truth datasets are frequently affected by\nsignificant class imbalance as generally they contain much more information\nregarding legal services (Exchange, Gambling), than regarding services that may\nbe related to illicit activities (Mixer, Service). Class imbalance increases\nthe complexity of applying machine learning techniques and reduces the quality\nof classification results, especially for underrepresented, but critical\nclasses.\n  In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) for Bitcoin data augmentation as GANs recently have\nshown promising results in the domain of image classification. However, there\nis no \"one-fits-all\" GAN solution that works for every scenario. In fact,\nsetting GAN training parameters is non-trivial and heavily affects the quality\nof the generated synthetic data. We therefore evaluate how GAN parameters such\nas the optimization function, the size of the dataset and the chosen batch size\naffect GAN implementation for one underrepresented entity class (Mining Pool)\nand demonstrate how a \"good\" GAN configuration can be obtained that achieves\nhigh similarity between synthetically generated and real Bitcoin address data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting GANs as a\nvalid tool for generating synthetic address data for data augmentation in\nBitcoin entity classification.\n",

Here we\nmake this link explicit for a conjectured representation of the Born rule which\nholds true if symmetric informationally complete POVMs (or SICs) exist for\nevery finite dimensional Hilbert space. We prove that an agent who thinks they\nare gambling on the outcomes of measurements on a sufficiently quantum-like\nsystem, but refuses to use this form of the Born rule when placing their bets\nis vulnerable to a Dutch book.

However,\nthe anonymization of blockchain hinders market regulation, resulting in\nincreasing illegal activities such as money laundering, gambling and phishing\nfraud on blockchain financial platforms. Thus, financial security has become a\ntop priority in the blockchain ecosystem, calling for effective market\nregulation. In this paper, we consider identifying Ethereum accounts from a\ngraph classification perspective, and propose an end-to-end graph neural\nnetwork framework named Ethident, to characterize the behavior patterns of\naccounts and further achieve account de-anonymization. Specifically, we first\nconstruct an Account Interaction Graph (AIG) using raw Ethereum data. Then we\ndesign a hierarchical graph attention encoder named HGATE as the backbone of\nour framework, which can effectively characterize the node-level account\nfeatures and subgraph-level behavior patterns. For alleviating account label\nscarcity, we further introduce contrastive self-supervision mechanism as\nregularization to jointly train our framework. Comprehensive experiments on\nEthereum datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance\nin account identification, yielding 1.13% ~ 4.93% relative improvement over\nprevious state-of-the-art. Furthermore, detailed analyses illustrate the\neffectiveness of Ethident in identifying and understanding the behavior of\nknown participants in Ethereum (e.g. exchanges, miners, etc.), as well as that\nof the lawbreakers (e.g. phishing scammers, hackers, etc.), which may aid in\nrisk assessment and market regulation.\n",

In this\nwork, we propose back-and-forth exploration, a novel automated Bitcoin\ntransaction tracing technique to identify cybercrime financial relationships.\nGiven seed addresses belonging to a cybercrime campaign, it outputs a\ntransaction graph, and identifies paths corresponding to relationships between\nthe campaign under study and external services and other cybercrime campaigns.\nBack-and-forth exploration provides two key contributions. First, it explores\nboth forward and backwards, instead of only forward as done by prior work,\nenabling the discovery of relationships that cannot be found by only exploring\nforward (e.g., deposits from clients of a mixer). Second, it prevents graph\nexplosion by combining a tagging database with a machine learning classifier\nfor identifying addresses belonging to exchanges. We evaluate back-and-forth\nexploration on 30 malware families. We build oracles for 4 families using\nBitcoin for C&C and use them to demonstrate that back-and-forth exploration\nidentifies 13 C&C signaling addresses missed by prior work, 8 of which are\nfundamentally missed by forward-only explorations. Our approach uncovers a\nwealth of services used by the malware including 44 exchanges, 11 gambling\nsites, 5 payment service providers, 4 underground markets, 4 mining pools, and\n2 mixers. In 4 families, the relations include new attribution points missed by\nforward-only explorations.

The\naddition provides an extra normative rule for decision-making agents concerned\nwith gambling across experimental contexts, somewhat in analogy to the\ndouble-slit experiment. This establishes the meaning of the Born Rule from a\nQBist perspective. Moreover it suggests that the best way to formulate the Born\nRule for foundational discussions is with respect to an informationally\ncomplete reference device. Recent work [DeBrota, Fuchs, and Stacey, Phys.

In this paper, we attempt to answer the analogous question for\nreal-vector-space quantum theory. While standard quantum mechanics seems to\nallow SICs to exist in all finite dimensions, in the case of quantum theory\nover the real numbers it is known that SICs do not exist in most dimensions. We\ntherefore attempt to identify the optimal reference device in the first real\ndimension without a SIC (i.e., $d=4$) in hopes of better understanding the\nessential role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics. In contrast to their\ncomplex counterparts, the expressions that result in a QBist understanding of\nreal-vector-space quantum theory are surprisingly complex.\n",

Unlike traditional malware, most of them (over 80%) do\nnot have malicious payloads. Due to their unique characteristics, existing\ndetection approaches cannot effectively and efficiently mitigate this emerging\nthreat.\n  To address this problem, we propose a novel approach to effectively and\nefficiently detect UEware by considering their UI transition graphs (UTGs).\nBased on the proposed approach, we design and implement a system named\nDeUEDroid to perform the detection. To evaluate DeUEDroid, we collect 25,717\napps and build the first large-scale ground-truth dataset (1,700 apps) of\nUEware. The evaluation result based on the ground-truth dataset shows that\nDeUEDroid can cover new UI features and statically construct precise UTG. It\nachieves 98.22% detection F1-score and 98.97% classification accuracy,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional approaches. The evaluation involving\n24,017 apps demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of UEware detection\nin real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the result reveals that UEware are\nprevalent, with 54% of apps in the wild and 11% of apps in app stores being\nUEware.

Modern QRNGs that certify their privacy\nare posed to replace widely adopted pseudo and true classical random number\ngenerators in applications such as encryption and gambling, and therefore, need\nto be cheap, fast and with integration capabilities. Using a compact\nmetal-halide PeLED source, we generate random numbers, which are certified to\nbe secure against an eavesdropper, following the quantum\nmeasurement-device-independent scenario. The obtained random number generation\nrate of more than 10 Mbit s$^{-1}$, which is already comparable to actual\ncommercial devices, shows that PeLEDs can work as high-quality light sources\nfor quantum information tasks, thus paving the way for future developments of\nquantum technologies. Lastly, we argue that the simpler PeLED manufacturing\nprocess, when comparing to solid-state devices, may have large environmental\nimpacts when quantum technology systems become more mass produced, due to the\npossible lower carbon footprint.\n",

        "summary": "  Decisions such as which movie to watch next, which song to listen to, or\nwhich product to buy online, are increasingly influenced by recommender systems\nand user models that incorporate information on users' past behaviours,\npreferences, and digitally created content. Machine learning models that enable\nrecommendations and that are trained on user data may unintentionally leverage\ninformation on human characteristics that are considered vulnerabilities, such\nas depression, young age, or gambling addiction. The use of algorithmic\ndecisions based on latent vulnerable state representations could be considered\nmanipulative and could have a deteriorating impact on the condition of\nvulnerable individuals. In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of\nmachine learning models inadvertently modelling vulnerabilities, and want to\nraise awareness for this issue to be considered in legislation and AI ethics.\nHence, we define and describe common vulnerabilities, and illustrate cases\nwhere they are likely to play a role in algorithmic decision-making. We propose\na set of requirements for methods to detect the potential for vulnerability\nmodelling, detect whether vulnerable groups are treated differently by a model,\nand detect whether a model has created an internal representation of\nvulnerability. We conclude that explainable artificial intelligence methods may\nbe necessary for detecting vulnerability exploitation by machine learning-based\nrecommendation systems.\n",

        "summary": "  We consider the problem of estimating the mean of a sequence of random\nelements $f(X_1, \\theta)$ $, \\ldots, $ $f(X_n, \\theta)$ where $f$ is a fixed\nscalar function, $S=(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)$ are independent random variables, and\n$\\theta$ is a possibly $S$-dependent parameter. An example of such a problem\nwould be to estimate the generalization error of a neural network trained on\n$n$ examples where $f$ is a loss function. Classically, this problem is\napproached through concentration inequalities holding uniformly over compact\nparameter sets of functions $f$, for example as in Rademacher or VC type\nanalysis. However, in many problems, such inequalities often yield numerically\nvacuous estimates. Recently, the \\emph{PAC-Bayes} framework has been proposed\nas a better alternative for this class of problems for its ability to often\ngive numerically non-vacuous bounds. In this paper, we show that we can do even\nbetter: we show how to refine the proof strategy of the PAC-Bayes bounds and\nachieve \\emph{even tighter} guarantees. Our approach is based on the\n\\emph{coin-betting} framework that derives the numerically tightest known\ntime-uniform concentration inequalities from the regret guarantees of online\ngambling algorithms. In particular, we derive the first PAC-Bayes concentration\ninequality based on the coin-betting approach that holds simultaneously for all\nsample sizes. We demonstrate its tightness showing that by \\emph{relaxing} it\nwe obtain a number of previous results in a closed form including Bernoulli-KL\nand empirical Bernstein inequalities. Finally, we propose an efficient\nalgorithm to numerically calculate confidence sequences from our bound, which\noften generates nonvacuous confidence bounds even with one sample, unlike the\nstate-of-the-art PAC-Bayes bounds.\n",

Various types of visualizations have been proposed that\ntake this spatio-temporal nature of the data into account, but it is unclear\nhow well each one can be interpreted and whether such interpretation depends on\nthe question asked about the data or the nature of the data-set that is being\nvisualised. In this study, four spatio-temporal visualization techniques for\neye movements (chord diagram, scanpath, scarfplot, space-time cube) were\ncompared in a user study. Participants (N = 25) answered three questions (what\nregion first, what region most, which regions most between) about each\nvisualization, which was based on two types of data-sets (eye movements towards\nadverts, eye movements towards pairs of gambles). Accuracy of the answers\ndepended on a combination of the data-set, the question that needed to\nanswered, and the type of visualization. For most questions, the scanpath,\nwhich did not use area of interest (AOI) information, resulted in lower\naccuracy than the other graphs. This suggests that AOIs improve the information\nconveyed by graphs. No effects of experience with reading graphs (for work or\nnot for work) or education on accuracy of the answer was found. The results\ntherefore suggest that there is no single best visualisation of the\nspatio-temporal aspects of eye movements. When visualising eye movement data, a\nuser study may therefore be beneficial to determine the optimal visualization\nof the data-set and research question at hand.\n",

The empirical work reveals that market crowd trade a stock in\nefficient adaptation except for simple heuristics, gradually tend to achieve\nagreement on an outcome or an asset price widely on a trading day, and generate\nsuch a stationary equilibrium price very often in interaction and competition\namong themselves no matter whether it is highly overestimated or\nunderestimated. This suggests that asset prices include not only a fundamental\nvalue but also private information, speculative, sentiment, attention, gamble,\nand entertainment values etc. Moreover, market crowd adapt to gain and loss by\ntrading volume increase or decrease significantly in interaction with\nenvironment in any two consecutive trading days.

But upon a deeper look, considering that the\nJackpot prize of lotteries is a result of the active participation of millions\nof players, we come to the conclusion that the interaction of the simple rules\nwith the high number of players creates an emergent complex system. Such a\nsystem is characterized by its time-series that presents some interesting\nproperties. Given the inherent stochastic nature of this game, it can be\ndescribed within a mean-field type approach, such as the one implemented in the\nLocal Growth and Global Reset (LGGR) model. We argue that the Jackpot\ntime-series behaves ergodic for six lotteries with diverse formats and player\npools. Specifying this consideration in the framework of the LGGR model, we\nmodel the lotteries with growth rates confirmed by the time-series. The reset\nrate is deduced mathematically and confirmed by data. Given these parameters we\ncalculate the probability density of the Jackpot prizes, that fits well the\nempirically observed ones.

Due to erratic energy patterns from the ambient, their executions\nbecome intermittent; periods of active computation are interleaved by periods\nof recharging small energy buffers. To cross periods of energy unavailability,\na device persists application and system state onto Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)\nin anticipation of energy failures. We purposely control the energy invested in\nthese operations, representing a major energy overhead, when using\nSpin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random-Access Memory (STT-MRAM) as NVM. As a\nresult, we abate the corresponding overhead, yet introduce write errors. Based\non 1.9+ trillion experimental data points, we illustrate whether this is a\ngamble worth taking, when, and where. We measure the energy consumption and\nquality of output obtained from the execution of nine diverse benchmarks on top\nof seven different platforms. Our results allow us to draw three key\nobservations: i) the trade-off between energy saving and reduction of output\nquality is program-specific; ii) the same trade-off is a function of a\nplatform's specific compute efficiency and power figures; and iii) data\nencoding and input size impact a program's resilience to errors.

Here, we extend this work by\nrestricting the possible connections between agents via a lattice network.\nUnder these restrictions, we still find that all agents profit from cooperating\nthrough insurance. We, though, further find that clusters of poor and rich\nagents emerge endogenously on the two-dimensional map and that wealth\ninequalities persist for a long duration, consistent with the phenomenon known\nas the poverty trap. By tuning the parameters which control the risk levels, we\nsimulate both highly advantageous and extremely risky gambles and show that\ndespite the qualitative shift in the type of risk, the findings are consistent.\n",

While many researchers have\nfocused on testing smart contracts, our recent work has highlighted a gap\nbetween test adequacy and test data generation, despite numerous efforts in\nboth fields. Our framework, Griffin, tackles this deficiency by employing a\ntargeted symbolic execution technique for generating test data.

This paper\ndiscusses how smart contracts differ from legacy software in targeted symbolic\nexecution and how these differences can affect the tool structure, leading us\nto propose an enhanced version of the control-flow graph for Solidity smart\ncontracts called CFG+. We also discuss how Griffin can utilize custom\nheuristics to explore the program space and find the test data that reaches a\ntarget line while considering a safety condition in a reasonable execution\ntime.

However, at the warehousing level, there are\nstill no unambiguous recommendations on integrating anticipation with\nintelligent online optimization algorithms, nor an unbiased benchmark to assess\nthe improvement potential of advanced anticipation over myopic techniques, as\noptimal online solutions are usually unavailable. In this paper, we compute and\nanalyze Complete-Information Optimal policy Solutions (CIOSs), of an exact\nperfect anticipation algorithm with full knowledge of future customer orders'\narrival times and items, for picking operations in picker-to-parts warehouses.\nWe provide analytical properties and leverage CIOSs to uncover decision\npatterns that enhance simpler algorithms, improving both makespan (costs) and\norder turnover (delivery speed). Using a metric similar to the gap to\noptimality, we quantify the gains from optimization elements and the\nimprovements remaining for advanced anticipation mechanisms. To compute CIOSs,\nwe design the first exact algorithm for the Order Batching, Sequencing, and\nRouting Problem with Release Times (OBSRP-R), based on dynamic programming. Our\nanalysis advises on the largely overlooked intervention - the dynamic\nadjustment of started batches, and the strategic relocation of an idle picker\ntowards future picking locations. The former affected over 60% of CIOS orders\nand triggered consistent improvements across warehousing policies. The latter\noccurred before 39%-62% CIOS orders and could decrease a myopic policy's gap to\noptimal turnover by 4.3% on average (up to 14%).

While these digital assets enable efficient and\nborderless financial transactions, their pseudonymous nature has also attracted\nmalicious activities such as money laundering, fraud, and other financial\ncrimes. Effective detection of malicious transactions is crucial to maintaining\nthe security and integrity of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Existing malicious\ntransaction detection methods rely on large amounts of labeled data and suffer\nfrom low generalization. Label-efficient and generalizable malicious\ntransaction detection remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose\nShadowEyes, a novel malicious transaction detection method. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a generalized graph structure named TxGraph as a representation\nof malicious transaction, which captures the interaction features of each\nmalicious account and its neighbors. Then we carefully design a data\naugmentation method tailored to simulate the evolution of malicious\ntransactions to generate positive pairs. To alleviate account label scarcity,\nwe further design a graph contrastive mechanism, which enables ShadowEyes to\nlearn discriminative features effectively from unlabeled data, thereby\nenhancing its detection capabilities in real-world scenarios. We conduct\nextensive experiments using public datasets to evaluate the performance of\nShadowEyes. The results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods in four typical scenarios. Specifically, in the zero-shot learning\nscenario, it can achieve an F1 score of 76.98% for identifying gambling\ntransactions, surpassing the SOTA method by12.05%. In the scenario of\nacross-platform malicious transaction detection, ShadowEyes maintains an F1\nscore of around 90%, which is 10% higher than the SOTA method.\n",

        "summary": "  In recent years,the application of deep learning in task functional Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (tfMRI) decoding has led to significant advancements.\nHowever,most studies remain constrained by assumption of temporal stationarity\nin neural activity,resulting in predominantly block-wise analysis with limited\ntemporal resolution on the order of tens of seconds. This limitation restricts\nthe ability to decode cognitive functions in detail. To address these\nlimitations, this study proposes a deep neural network designed for volume-wise\nidentification of task states within tfMRI data,thereby overcoming the\nconstraints of conventional methods. Evaluated on Human Connectome Project\n(HCP) motor and gambling tfMRI datasets,the model achieved impressive mean\naccuracy rates of 94.0% and 79.6%,respectively. These results demonstrate a\nsubstantial enhancement in temporal resolution,enabling more detailed\nexploration of cognitive processes. The study further employs visualization\nalgorithms to investigate dynamic brain mappings during different tasks,marking\na significant step forward in deep learning-based frame-level tfMRI decoding.\nThis approach offers new methodologies and tools for examining dynamic changes\nin brain activities and understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms.\n",

        "summary": "  Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas\nincluding quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches.\nTheir extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which\nmakes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to\nunderstand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity and how they change as\nthe cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We\nfound that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature\n$T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described\nby the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below\n$T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift\nof the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the\nsuperconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin\nto dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130\nmK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature\nof the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.\n",

This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as\nBB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using\nsolely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to\nperform quantum error correction on a $2 \\times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic\nlayout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for\nqubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific\nto bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the\nsparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits\ndistributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose\nphysical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be\nfaithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms,\nelectrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long\nion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the\ndistributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ when\nthe physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.\n",

        "summary": "  Understanding and classifying human cognitive brain states based on\nneuroimaging data remains one of the foremost and most challenging problems in\nneuroscience, owing to the high dimensionality and intrinsic noise of the\nsignals. In this work, we propose an ensemble-based graph representation method\nof functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the task of binary\nbrain-state classification. Our method builds the graph by leveraging multiple\nbase machine-learning models: each edge weight reflects the difference in\nposterior probabilities between two cognitive states, yielding values in the\nrange [-1, 1] that encode confidence in a given state. We applied this approach\nto seven cognitive tasks from the Human Connectome Project (HCP 1200 Subject\nRelease), including working memory, gambling, motor activity, language, social\ncognition, relational processing, and emotion processing. Using only the mean\nincident edge weights of the graphs as features, a simple logistic-regression\nclassifier achieved average accuracies from 97.07% to 99.74%. We also compared\nour ensemble graphs with classical correlation-based graphs in a classification\ntask with a graph neural network (GNN). In all experiments, the highest\nclassification accuracy was obtained with ensemble graphs. These results\ndemonstrate that ensemble graphs convey richer topological information and\nenhance brain-state discrimination. Our approach preserves edge-level\ninterpretability of the fMRI graph representation, is adaptable to multiclass\nand regression tasks, and can be extended to other neuroimaging modalities and\npathological-state classification.\n",

        "summary": "  We study the computational complexity of central analysis problems for\nOne-Counter Markov Decision Processes (OC-MDPs), a class of finitely-presented,\ncountable-state MDPs. OC-MDPs are equivalent to a controlled extension of\n(discrete-time) Quasi-Birth-Death processes (QBDs), a stochastic model studied\nheavily in queueing theory and applied probability. They can thus be viewed as\na natural ``adversarial'' version of a classic stochastic model. Alternatively,\nthey can also be viewed as a natural probabilistic/controlled extension of\nclassic one-counter automata. OC-MDPs also subsume (as a very restricted\nspecial case) a recently studied MDP model called ``solvency games'' that model\na risk-averse gambling scenario. Basic computational questions about these\nmodels include ``termination'' questions and ``limit'' questions, such as the\nfollowing: does the controller have a ``strategy'' (or ``policy'') to ensure\nthat the counter (which may for example count the number of jobs in the queue)\nwill hit value 0 (the empty queue) almost surely (a.s.)? Or that it will have\ninfinite limsup value, a.s.? Or, that it will hit value 0 in selected terminal\nstates, a.s.? Or, in case these are not satisfied a.s., compute the maximum\n(supremum) such probability over all strategies. We provide new upper and lower\nbounds on the complexity of such problems. For some of them we present a\npolynomial-time algorithm, whereas for others we show PSPACE- or BH-hardness\nand give an EXPTIME upper bound. Our upper bounds combine techniques from the\ntheory of MDP reward models, the theory of random walks, and a variety of\nautomata-theoretic methods.\n",

Random numbers, however, are difficult to\ncharacterize mathematically, and their generation must rely on an unpredictable\nphysical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes\nor failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the\nreliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control\nand detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on nonlocality based and device\nindependent quantum information processing, we show that the nonlocal\ncorrelations of entangled quantum particles can be used to certify the presence\nof genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design of a new type of\ncryptographically secure random number generator which does not require any\nassumption on the internal working of the devices. This strong form of\nrandomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems\nonly if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a\nproof-of-concept demonstration of this proposal in a system of two entangled\natoms separated by approximately 1 meter. The observed Bell inequality\nviolation, featuring near-perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new\nrandom numbers are generated with 99% confidence. Our results lay the\ngroundwork for future device-independent quantum information experiments and\nfor addressing fundamental issues raised by the intrinsic randomness of quantum\ntheory.\n",

        "summary": "  Randomness is an important resource for many applications, from gambling to\nsecure communication. However, guaranteeing that the output from a candidate\nrandom source could not have been predicted by an outside party is a\nchallenging task, and many supposedly random sources used today provide no such\nguarantee. Quantum solutions to this problem exist, for example a device which\ninternally sends a photon through a beam-splitter and observes on which side it\nemerges, but, presently, such solutions require the user to trust the internal\nworkings of the device. Here we seek to go beyond this limitation by asking\nwhether randomness can be generated using untrusted devices---even ones created\nby an adversarial agent---while providing a guarantee that no outside party\n(including the agent) can predict it. Since this is easily seen to be\nimpossible unless the user has an initially private random string, the task we\ninvestigate here is private randomness expansion.\n  We introduce a protocol for private randomness expansion with untrusted\ndevices which is designed to take as input an initially private random string\nand produce as output a longer private random string. We point out that private\nrandomness expansion protocols are generally vulnerable to attacks that can\nrender the initial string partially insecure, even though that string is used\nonly inside a secure laboratory; our protocol is designed to remove this\npreviously unconsidered vulnerability by privacy amplification. We also discuss\nextensions of our protocol designed to generate an arbitrarily long random\nstring from a finite initially private random string. The security of these\nprotocols against the most general attacks is left as an open question.\n",

While this design appealed to the gambling\ninstinct, it is a suboptimal way to manage longevity risk during retirement.\nThis is why fair life annuities making constant payments -- where the insurance\ncompany is exposed to the longevity risk -- induces greater lifetime utility.\nHowever, tontines do not have to be designed using a winner-take-all approach\nand insurance companies do not actually sell fair life annuities, partially due\nto aggregate longevity risk.\n  In this paper we derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime\nutility, but doesn't expose the sponsor to any longevity risk. We examine its\nsensitivity to the size of the tontine pool; individual longevity risk\naversion; and subjective health status. The optimal tontine varies with the\nindividual's longevity risk aversion $\\gamma$ and the number of participants\n$n$, which is problematic for product design. That said, we introduce a\nstructure called a natural tontine whose payout declines in exact proportion to\nthe (expected) survival probabilities, which is near-optimal for all $\\gamma$\nand $n$. We compare the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded\nlife annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find\nthat the life annuity's advantage over tontines, is minimal.\n  We also review and analyze the first-ever mortality-derivative issued by the\nBritish government, known as King Williams's tontine of 1693. We shed light on\nthe preferences and beliefs of those who invested in the tontines vs. the\nannuities and argue that tontines should be re-introduced and allowed to\nco-exist with life annuities. Individuals would likely select a portfolio of\ntontines and annuities that suit their personal preferences for consumption and\nlongevity risk, as they did over 320 years ago.\n",

This qubit is not just simple but also has the potential for\nhigh-speed operation, because of the strong coupling of electric fields to the\nelectron. However, charge noise also couples strongly to this qubit, resulting\nin rapid dephasing at nearly all operating points, with the exception of one\nspecial 'sweet spot'. Fast dc voltage pulses have been used to manipulate\nsemiconductor charge qubits, but these previous experiments did not achieve\nhigh-fidelity control, because dc gating requires excursions away from the\nsweet spot. Here, by using resonant ac microwave driving, we achieve coherent\nmanipulation of a semiconductor charge qubit, demonstrating a Rabi frequency of\nup to 2GHz, a value approaching the intrinsic qubit frequency of 4.5GHz. Z-axis\nrotations of the qubit are well-protected at the sweet spot, and by using ac\ngating, we demonstrate the same protection for rotations about arbitrary axes\nin the X-Y plane of the qubit Bloch sphere. We characterize operations on the\nqubit using two independent tomographic approaches: standard process tomography\nand a newly developed method known as gate set tomography.

In this framework the algorithm is shown\na pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of $n$ items. The learner then\npredicts a label for each item, from a label set of size $L$ and receives a\nreal valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting\nscenarios such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut\namong others. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning\nalgorithm for this problem achieving a regret of $O(\\sqrt{nL^3T})$, where $T$\nis the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of\n$O(\\sqrt{n \\log L T})$. One of the main open questions left in this framework\nconcerns closing the above gap.\n  In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main\nresults. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming\nbased algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a), in fact achieves a regret of\n$O(\\sqrt{nLT})$. Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely,\nwe show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower\nregret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem\nwhich is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a\nrelated conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike\nplanted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known\nquasi-polynomial time algorithms.\n  Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we\nhope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other\nonline learning scenarios as well.\n",

The equivalence\nallows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint of desirability\nand through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions. On this basis, we\nobtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of\nincomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst\nact---no best act is needed---, and that a weakened Archimedean axiom suffices\ntoo; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity\nassumption (that probabilities should be positive---they need not), which\nenables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is\nalways possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a\nworst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a\ntrivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence\ncoincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise\nprobability---this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state\nindependence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of\ncomplete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not\ncapture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities\nand we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly,\nwe argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to\nmodel, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in case of non-Archimedean\nproblems. This leads us to suggest that desirability, rather than preference,\nshould be the primitive notion at the basis of decision-theoretic\naxiomatisations.\n",

Indeed, actuarially-fair life\nannuities making constant payments -- where the insurance company is exposed to\nlongevity risk -- induce greater lifetime utility. However, tontines do not\nhave to be structured the historical way, i.e. with a constant cash flow shared\namongst a shrinking group of survivors.

Technically\nspeaking we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation and examine its sensitivity to\n(i.) the size of the tontine pool $n$, and (ii.) individual longevity risk\naversion $\\gamma$. We examine how the optimal tontine varies with $\\gamma$ and\n$n$, and prove some qualitative theorems about the optimal payout.\nInterestingly, Lorenzo de Tonti's original structure is optimal in the limit as\nlongevity risk aversion $\\gamma \\to \\infty$. We define the natural tontine as\nthe function for which the payout declines in exact proportion to the survival\nprobabilities, which we show is near-optimal for all $\\gamma$ and $n$.

Researchers predict the need for an integrated\nplatform in order to implement useful computation, and decades of advancements\nin silicon microelectronics fabrication lends itself to this challenge.\nHowever, fundamental concerns have been raised about the MOS interface (e.g.\ntrap noise, variations in electron g-factor and practical implementation of\nmulti-QDs). Furthermore, two-axis control of silicon qubits has, to date,\nrequired the integration of non-ideal components (e.g. microwave strip-lines,\nmicro-magnets, triple quantum dots, or introduction of donor atoms). In this\npaper, we introduce a spin-orbit (SO) driven singlet-triplet (ST) qubit in\nsilicon, demonstrating all-electrical two-axis control that requires no\nadditional integrated elements and exhibits charge noise properties equivalent\nto other more model, but less commercially mature, semiconductor systems. We\ndemonstrate the ability to tune an intrinsic spin-orbit interface effect, which\nis consistent with Rashba and Dresselhaus contributions that are remarkably\nstrong for a low spin-orbit material such as silicon. The qubit maintains the\nadvantages of using isotopically enriched silicon for producing a quiet\nmagnetic environment, measuring spin dephasing times of 1.6 $\\mu$s using 99.95%\n$^{28}$Si epitaxy for the qubit, comparable to results from other isotopically\nenhanced silicon ST qubit systems.

In this setting, there is a large body of literature which\nincludes arguments that the theory often leads to bets which are \"too\naggressive\" with respect to various risk metrics. To remedy this problem, many\npapers include prescriptions for scaling down the bet size. Such schemes are\nreferred to as Fractional Kelly Betting. In this paper, we take the opposite\ntack. That is, we show that in many cases, the theoretical Kelly-based results\nmay lead to bets which are \"too conservative\" rather than too aggressive. To\nmake this argument, we consider a random vector X with its assumed probability\ndistribution and draw m samples to obtain an empirically-derived counterpart\nXhat. Subsequently, we derive and compare the resulting Kelly bets for both X\nand Xhat with consideration of sample size m as part of the analysis. This\nleads to identification of many cases which have the following salient feature:\nThe resulting bet size using the true theoretical distribution for X is much\nsmaller than that for Xhat. If instead the bet is based on empirical data,\n\"golden\" opportunities are identified which are essentially rejected when the\npurely theoretical model is used. To formalize these ideas, we provide a result\nwhich we call the Restricted Betting Theorem. An extreme case of the theorem is\nobtained when X has unbounded support. In this situation, using X, the Kelly\ntheory can lead to no betting at all.\n",

While widely debated in sports, gambling,\nand financial markets over the past several decades, little is known if hot\nstreaks apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on\nlifecycle of creativity, we collected large-scale career histories of\nindividual artists, movie directors and scientists, tracing the artworks,\nmovies, and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all\nthree domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal\nregularity, each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works\noccurring in sequence. We demonstrate that these observations can be explained\nby a simple hot-streak model we developed, allowing us to probe quantitatively\nthe hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers, which we find to be\nremarkably universal across diverse domains we analyzed: The hot streaks are\nubiquitous yet unique across different careers. While the vast majority of\nindividuals have at least one hot streak, hot streaks are most likely to occur\nonly once. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual's sequence of\nworks, is temporally localized, and is unassociated with any detectable change\nin productivity. We show that, since works produced during hot streaks garner\nsignificantly more impact, the uncovered hot streaks fundamentally drives the\ncollective impact of an individual, ignoring which leads us to systematically\nover- or under-estimate the future impact of a career. These results not only\ndeepen our quantitative understanding of patterns governing individual\ningenuity and success, they may also have implications for decisions and\npolicies involving predicting and nurturing individuals with lasting impact.\n",

CYGNO is a new proposal\nsupported by INFN, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics, within\nCYGNUs proto-collaboration (CYGNUS-TPC) that aims to realize a distributed\nobservatory in underground laboratories for directional Dark Matter (DM) search\nand the identification of the coherent neutrino scattering (CNS) from the Sun.\nCYGNO is one of the first prototypes in the road map to 100-1000 m^3 of CYGNUs\nand will be located at the National Laboratory of Gran Sasso (LNGS), in Italy,\naiming to make significant advances in the technology of single phase gas-only\ntime projection chambers (TPC) for the application to the detection of rare\nscattering events. In particular it will focus on a read-out technique based on\nMicro Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) amplification of the ionization and on the\nvisible light collection with a sub-mm position resolution sCMOS (scientific\nCOMS) camera. This type of readout - in conjunction with a fast light detection\n- will allow on one hand to reconstruct 3D direction of the tracks, offering\naccurate sensitivity to the source directionality and, on the other hand, a\nhigh particle identification capability very useful to distinguish nuclear\nrecoils.\n",

        "summary": "  Humanity has been fascinated by the pursuit of fortune since time immemorial,\nand many successful outcomes benefit from strokes of luck. But success is\nsubject to complexity, uncertainty, and change - and at times becoming\nincreasingly unequally distributed. This leads to tension and confusion over to\nwhat extent people actually get what they deserve (i.e., fairness/meritocracy).\nMoreover, in many fields, humans are over-confident and pervasively confuse\nluck for skill (I win, it's skill; I lose, it's bad luck). In some fields,\nthere is too much risk taking; in others, not enough. Where success derives in\nlarge part from luck - and especially where bailouts skew the incentives\n(heads, I win; tails, you lose) - it follows that luck is rewarded too much.\nThis incentivizes a culture of gambling, while downplaying the importance of\nproductive effort. And, short term success is often rewarded, irrespective, and\npotentially at the detriment, of the long-term system fitness. However, much\nsuccess is truly meritocratic, and the problem is to discern and reward based\non merit. We call this the fair reward problem. To address this, we propose\nthree different measures to assess merit: (i) raw outcome; (ii) risk adjusted\noutcome, and (iii) prospective. We emphasize the need, in many cases, for the\ndeductive prospective approach, which considers the potential of a system to\nadapt and mutate in novel futures. This is formalized within an evolutionary\nsystem, comprised of five processes, inter alia handling the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off. Several human endeavors - including\nfinance, politics, and science -are analyzed through these lenses, and concrete\nsolutions are proposed to support a prosperous and meritocratic society.\n",

        "summary": "  In the global move toward urbanization, making sure the people remaining in\nrural areas are not left behind in terms of development and policy\nconsiderations is a priority for governments worldwide. However, it is\nincreasingly challenging to track important statistics concerning this sparse,\ngeographically dispersed population, resulting in a lack of reliable,\nup-to-date data. In this study, we examine the usefulness of the Facebook\nAdvertising platform, which offers a digital \"census\" of over two billions of\nits users, in measuring potential rural-urban inequalities. We focus on Italy,\na country where about 30% of the population lives in rural areas. First, we\nshow that the population statistics that Facebook produces suffer from\ninstability across time and incomplete coverage of sparsely populated\nmunicipalities. To overcome such limitation, we propose an alternative\nmethodology for estimating Facebook Ads audiences that nearly triples the\ncoverage of the rural municipalities from 19% to 55% and makes feasible\nfine-grained sub-population analysis. Using official national census data, we\nevaluate our approach and confirm known significant urban-rural divides in\nterms of educational attainment and income. Extending the analysis to\nFacebook-specific user \"interests\" and behaviors, we provide further insights\non the divide, for instance, finding that rural areas show a higher interest in\ngambling. Notably, we find that the most predictive features of income in rural\nareas differ from those for urban centres, suggesting researchers need to\nconsider a broader range of attributes when examining rural wellbeing. The\nfindings of this study illustrate the necessity of improving existing tools and\nmethodologies to include under-represented populations in digital demographic\nstudies -- the failure to do so could result in misleading observations,\nconclusions, and most importantly, policies.\n",

This paper presents a large-scale study on one particular\ndelivery method of online scam: pop-up scam on typosquatting domains.\nTyposquatting describes the concept of registering domains which are very\nsimilar to existing ones while deliberately containing common typing errors;\nthese domains are then used to trick online users while under the belief of\nbrowsing the intended website. Pop-up scam uses JavaScript alert boxes to\npresent a message which attracts the user's attention very effectively, as they\nare a blocking user interface element.\n  Our study among typosquatting domains derived from the Majestic Million list\nutilising an Austrian IP address revealed on 1219 distinct typosquatting URLs a\ntotal of 2577 pop-up messages, out of which 1538 were malicious. Approximately\na third of those distinct URLs (403) were targeted and displayed pop-up\nmessages to one specific HTTP user agent only. Based on our scans, we present\nan in-depth analysis as well as a detailed classification of different\ntargeting parameters (user agent and language) which triggered varying kinds of\npop-up scams. Furthermore, we expound the differences of current pop-up scam\ncharacteristics in comparison with a previous scan performed in late 2018 and\nexamine the use of IDN homograph attacks as well as the application of message\nlocalisation using additional scans with IP addresses from the United States\nand Japan.\n",

The simulator, named the \"Bristol Betting\nExchange\" (BBE), is intended as a common platform, a data-source and\nexperimental test-bed, for researchers studying the application of AI and\nmachine learning (ML) techniques to issues arising in betting exchanges; and,\nas far as I have been able to determine, BBE is the first of its kind: a free\nopen-source agent-based simulation model consisting not only of a\nsports-betting exchange, but also a minimal simulation model of racetrack\nsporting events (e.g., horse-races or car-races) about which bets may be made,\nand a population of simulated bettors who each form their own private\nevaluation of odds and place bets on the exchange before and - crucially -\nduring the race itself (i.e., so-called \"in-play\" betting) and whose betting\nopinions change second-by-second as each race event unfolds. BBE is offered as\na proof-of-concept system that enables the generation of large high-resolution\ndata-sets for automated discovery or improvement of profitable strategies for\nbetting on sporting events via the application of AI/ML and advanced data\nanalytics techniques. This paper offers an extensive survey of relevant\nliterature and explains the motivation and design of BBE, and presents brief\nillustrative results.\n",

Its properties\nallow us to improve the state-of-the-art bounds on the bit complexity for the\nproblems of root isolation and approximate multipoint evaluation. This data\nstructure also leads to a new geometric criterion to detect ill-conditioned\npolynomials, implying notably that the standard condition number of the zeros\nof a polynomial is at least exponential in the number of roots of modulus less\nthan $1/2$ or greater than $2$.Given a polynomial $f$ of degree $d$ with\n$\\|f\\|_1 \\leq 2^\\tau$ for $\\tau \\geq 1$, isolating all its complex roots or\nevaluating it at $d$ points can be done with a quasi-linear number of\narithmetic operations. However, considering the bit complexity, the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms require at least $d^{3/2}$ bit operations even for\nwell-conditioned polynomials and when the accuracy required is low. Given a\npositive integer $m$, we can compute our new data structure and evaluate $f$ at\n$d$ points in the unit disk with an absolute error less than $2^{-m}$ in\n$\\widetilde O(d(\\tau+m))$ bit operations, where $\\widetilde O(\\cdot)$ means\nthat we omit logarithmic factors. We also show that if $\\kappa$ is the absolute\ncondition number of the zeros of $f$, then we can isolate all the roots of $f$\nin $\\widetilde O(d(\\tau + \\log \\kappa))$ bit operations. Moreover, our\nalgorithms are simple to implement. For approximating the complex roots of a\npolynomial, we implemented a small prototype in \\verb|Python/NumPy| that is an\norder of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art solver \\verb/MPSolve/ for\nhigh degree polynomials with random coefficients.\n",

        "summary": "  Finite-state dimension, introduced early in this century as a finite-state\nversion of classical Hausdorff dimension, is a quantitative measure of the\nlower asymptotic density of information in an infinite sequence over a finite\nalphabet, as perceived by finite automata. Finite-state dimension is a robust\nconcept that now has equivalent formulations in terms of finite-state gambling,\nlossless finite-state data compression, finite-state prediction, entropy rates,\nand automatic Kolmogorov complexity. The Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem gave\nthe first automata-theoretic characterization of normal sequences, which had\nbeen studied in analytic number theory since Borel defined them. This theorem\nimplies that a sequence (or a real number having this sequence as its base-b\nexpansion) is normal if and only if it has finite-state dimension 1. One of the\nmost powerful classical tools for investigating normal numbers is the Weyl\ncriterion, which characterizes normality in terms of exponential sums. Such\nsums are well studied objects with many connections to other aspects of\nanalytic number theory, and this has made use of Weyl criterion especially\nfruitful. This raises the question whether Weyl criterion can be generalized\nfrom finite-state dimension 1 to arbitrary finite-state dimensions, thereby\nmaking it a quantitative tool for studying data compression, prediction, etc.\n  This paper does exactly this. We extend the Weyl criterion from a\ncharacterization of sequences with finite-state dimension 1 to a criterion that\ncharacterizes every finite-state dimension. This turns out not to be a routine\ngeneralization of the original Weyl criterion. Even though exponential sums may\ndiverge for non-normal numbers, finite-state dimension can be characterized in\nterms of the dimensions of the subsequence limits of the exponential sums. We\ndemonstrate the utility of our criterion though examples.\n",

        "summary": "  Bitcoin is one of the decentralized cryptocurrencies powered by a\npeer-to-peer blockchain network. Parties who trade in the bitcoin network are\nnot required to disclose any personal information. Such property of anonymity,\nhowever, precipitates potential malicious transactions to a certain extent.\nIndeed, various illegal activities such as money laundering, dark network\ntrading, and gambling in the bitcoin network are nothing new now. While a\nproliferation of work has been developed to identify malicious bitcoin\ntransactions, the behavior analysis and classification of bitcoin addresses are\nlargely overlooked by existing tools. In this paper, we propose BAClassifier, a\ntool that can automatically classify bitcoin addresses based on their\nbehaviors. Technically, we come up with the following three key designs. First,\nwe consider casting the transactions of the bitcoin address into an address\ngraph structure, of which we introduce a graph node compression technique and a\ngraph structure augmentation method to characterize a unified graph\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we leverage a graph feature network to learn the\ngraph representations of each address and generate the graph embeddings.\nFinally, we aggregate all graph embeddings of an address into the address-level\nrepresentation, and engage in a classification model to give the address\nbehavior classification. As a side contribution, we construct and release a\nlarge-scale annotated dataset that consists of over 2 million real-world\nbitcoin addresses and concerns 4 types of address behaviors. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art\nbitcoin address classifiers and existing classification models, where the\nprecision and F1-score are 96% and 95%, respectively. Our implementation and\ndataset are released, hoping to inspire others.\n",

Today, attempts to assess models' clinical\nknowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There\nis no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of\ntasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six\nexisting open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams,\nresearch, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset\nof medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human\nevaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality,\nprecision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a\n540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on\nMultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA,\nMedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US\nMedical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%.\nHowever, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve\nthis we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for\naligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model,\nMed-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show\nthat comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with\nmodel scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of\nLLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's\nmodels, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method\ndevelopment in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.\n",

Here, we use the same dataset as RRS to reproduce their\nresults exactly, thus confirming the robustness of their mispricing claim.\nHowever, we discover that the published betting results are significantly\naffected by a single bet (the \"Hercog\" bet), which returns substantial outlier\nprofits based on erroneously long odds. When this data quality issue is\nresolved, the majority of reported profits disappear and only one strategy,\nwhich bets on \"competitive\" matches, remains significantly profitable in the\noriginal out-of-sample period. While one profitable strategy offers weaker\nsupport than the original study, it still provides an indication that market\ninefficiencies may exist, as originally claimed by RRS. As an extension, we\ncontinue backtesting after 2020 on a cleaned dataset. Results show that (a) the\n\"competitive\" strategy generates no further profits, potentially suggesting\nmarkets have become more efficient, and (b) model coefficients estimated over\nthis more recent period are no longer reliable predictors of bookmaker\nmispricing. We present this work as a case study demonstrating the importance\nof replication studies in sports forecasting, and the necessity to clean data.\nWe open-source release comprehensive datasets and code.\n",

        "summary": "  We report the results of the stellar occultation by (UII) Umbriel on\nSeptember 21st, 2020. The shadow crossed the USA and Canada, and 19 positive\nchords were obtained. A limb parameter accounted for putative topographic\nfeatures in the limb fittings. Ellipse fittings were not robust - only upper\nlimits were derived for the true size/shape of a putative Umbriel ellipsoid.\nThe adopted spherical solution gives radius = 582.4 +/- 0.8 km, smaller/close\nto 584.7 +/- 2.8 km from Voyager II. The apparent ellipse fit results in a true\nsemi-major axis of 584.9 +/- 3.8 km, semi-minor axes of 582.3 +/- 0.6 km and\ntrue oblateness of 0.004 +/- 0.008 for a putative ellipsoid. The geometric\nalbedo was pV = 0.26 +/- 0.01. The density was rho = 1.54 +/- 0.04 g cm-3. The\nsurface gravity was 0.251 +/- 0.006 m s-2 and the escape velocity 0.541 +/-\n0.006 km s-1 . Upper limits of 13 and 72 nbar (at 1 sigma and 3 sigma levels,\nrespectively) were obtained for the surface pressure of a putative isothermal\nCO2 atmosphere at T = 70 K. A milliarcsecond precision position was derived: RA\n= 02h 30m 28.84556s +/- 0.1 mas, DE = 14o 19' 36.5836\" +/- 0.2 mas. A large\nlimb parameter of 4.2 km was obtained, in striking agreement with opposite\nsouthern hemisphere measurements by Voyager II in 1986. Occultation and Voyager\nresults indicate that the same strong topography variation in the surface of\nUmbriel is present on both hemispheres.\n",

        "summary": "  Chest X-rays (CXR) are essential for diagnosing a variety of conditions, but\nwhen used on new populations, model generalizability issues limit their\nefficacy. Generative AI, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models\n(DDPMs), offers a promising approach to generating synthetic images, enhancing\ndataset diversity. This study investigates the impact of synthetic data\nsupplementation on the performance and generalizability of medical imaging\nresearch. The study employed DDPMs to create synthetic CXRs conditioned on\ndemographic and pathological characteristics from the CheXpert dataset. These\nsynthetic images were used to supplement training datasets for pathology\nclassifiers, with the aim of improving their performance. The evaluation\ninvolved three datasets (CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and Emory Chest X-ray) and\nvarious experiments, including supplementing real data with synthetic data,\ntraining with purely synthetic data, and mixing synthetic data with external\ndatasets. Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating\ncurve (AUROC). Adding synthetic data to real datasets resulted in a notable\nincrease in AUROC values (up to 0.02 in internal and external test sets with\n1000% supplementation, p-value less than 0.01 in all instances). When\nclassifiers were trained exclusively on synthetic data, they achieved\nperformance levels comparable to those trained on real data with 200%-300% data\nsupplementation. The combination of real and synthetic data from different\nsources demonstrated enhanced model generalizability, increasing model AUROC\nfrom 0.76 to 0.80 on the internal test set (p-value less than 0.01). In\nconclusion, synthetic data supplementation significantly improves the\nperformance and generalizability of pathology classifiers in medical imaging.\n",

        "summary": "  QBism has long recognized quantum states, POVM elements, Kraus operators, and\neven unitary operations to be cut from the same cloth: They express aspects of\nan agent's belief system concerning the consequences (for her) of actions she\nmight take upon her external world. Such action-consequence pairs have\nconventionally been called \"quantum measurements.\" The calculus of quantum\ntheory is then viewed as an empirically motivated addition to Bayesian decision\ntheory when brought to this notion of measurement. This radical approach has\nallowed QBism to eliminate conceptual problems that plague other\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics. However, one issue has remained elusive:\nIf a QBist does not believe in the existence of an ontic (agent-independent)\ndynamical variable evolving over time, why would there be any constraints on\nher quantum-state assignment in the absence of performing a measurement? Why\nwould she introduce unitary or open-system quantum dynamics at all? Here, we\npresent a representation theorem based on van Fraassen's reflection principle\nto answer these questions. Simply put, an agent's assignment of quantum\ndynamics represents her belief that a measurement action she is contemplating\nwould not change her current odds for future gambles. A corollary to this\napproach is that one can make sense of \"open-system dynamics\" without the need\nto introduce an \"environment with a measurement record,\" as is common in\ndecoherence accounts of quantum measurement. QBism's understanding instead\nrests more fundamentally on an agent's beliefs about the system of interest\n(not system plus environment) and her judgments about measurements she might\nperform on that system. More broadly, this result establishes QBism's\ncontention that measurement itself is the central concept of quantum theory and\nthus the framework upon which any future QBist ontology must hang.\n",

        "summary": "  Let $f(\\theta, X_1),$ $ \\dots,$ $ f(\\theta, X_n)$ be a sequence of random\nelements, where $f$ is a fixed scalar function, $X_1, \\dots, X_n$ are\nindependent random variables (data), and $\\theta$ is a random parameter\ndistributed according to some data-dependent posterior distribution $P_n$. In\nthis paper, we consider the problem of proving concentration inequalities to\nestimate the mean of the sequence. An example of such a problem is the\nestimation of the generalization error of some predictor trained by a\nstochastic algorithm, such as a neural network where $f$ is a loss function.\nClassically, this problem is approached through a PAC-Bayes analysis where, in\naddition to the posterior, we choose a prior distribution which captures our\nbelief about the inductive bias of the learning problem. Then, the key quantity\nin PAC-Bayes concentration bounds is a divergence that captures the complexity\nof the learning problem where the de facto standard choice is the KL\ndivergence. However, the tightness of this choice has rarely been questioned.\n  In this paper, we challenge the tightness of the KL-divergence-based bounds\nby showing that it is possible to achieve a strictly tighter bound. In\nparticular, we demonstrate new high-probability PAC-Bayes bounds with a novel\nand better-than-KL divergence that is inspired by Zhang et al. (2022). Our\nproof is inspired by recent advances in regret analysis of gambling algorithms,\nand its use to derive concentration inequalities. Our result is\nfirst-of-its-kind in that existing PAC-Bayes bounds with non-KL divergences are\nnot known to be strictly better than KL. Thus, we believe our work marks the\nfirst step towards identifying optimal rates of PAC-Bayes bounds.\n",

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare\nfocusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on\nlong multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation\nsystem is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative\nagents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging\nconversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks\nperformed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a\nsophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that\noptimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data,\nclinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and\nother medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical\nprofessionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones\nbetween patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to\nexpress unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy\nand bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician\nevaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S.\nlicensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end\nconversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the\nsystem on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human\nnurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical\nreadiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner. Additionally, we conduct\na challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support\nagents, where we demonstrate our LLM agents significantly outperform a much\nlarger general-purpose LLM (GPT-4) as well as from its own medium-size class\n(LLaMA-2 70B).\n",

Our analysis shows that users\noften prefer DeFi over CeFi due to their decentralized nature and strong\nprofitability. Despite being aware that DeFi, compared to CeFi, is prone to\nmore severe attacks, users are willing to take those risks to explore new\ninvestment opportunities. Worryingly, most victims do not learn from previous\nexperiences; unlike victims studied through traditional systems, DeFi victims\ntend to find new services, without revising their security practices, to\nrecover their losses quickly. The abundance of various DeFi services and\nopportunities allows victims to continuously explore new financial\nopportunities, and this reality seems to cloud their security priorities.\nIndeed, our results indicate that DeFi users' strong financial motivations\noutweigh their security concerns - much like those who are addicted to\ngambling. Our observations about victims' post-incident behaviors suggest that\nstronger control in the form of industry regulations would be necessary to\nprotect DeFi users from future breaches.\n",

        "summary": "  Results are presented from the first underground data run of ZEPLIN-II, a 31\nkg two phase xenon detector developed to observe nuclear recoils from\nhypothetical weakly interacting massive dark matter particles. Discrimination\nbetween nuclear recoils and background electron recoils is afforded by\nrecording both the scintillation and ionisation signals generated within the\nliquid xenon, with the ratio of these signals being different for the two\nclasses of event. This ratio is calibrated for different incident species using\nan AmBe neutron source and Co-60 gamma-ray sources. From our first 31 live days\nof running ZEPLIN-II, the total exposure following the application of fiducial\nand stability cuts was 225 kgxdays. A background population of radon progeny\nevents was observed in this run, arising from radon emission in the gas\npurification getters, due to radon daughter ion decays on the surfaces of the\nwalls of the chamber. An acceptance window, defined by the neutron calibration\ndata, of 50% nuclear recoil acceptance between 5 keVee and 20 keVee, had an\nobserved count of 29 events, with a summed expectation of 28.6+/-4.3 gamma-ray\nand radon progeny induced background events. These figures provide a 90% c.l.\nupper limit to the number of nuclear recoils of 10.4 events in this acceptance\nwindow, which converts to a WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross-section with a\nminimum of 6.6x10^-7 pb following the inclusion of an energy dependent,\ncalibrated, efficiency. A second run is currently underway in which the radon\nprogeny will be eliminated, thereby removing the background population, with a\nprojected sensitivity of 2x10^-7 pb for similar exposures as the first run.\n",

        "summary": "  Quaoar is a classical Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO) with an area equivalent\ndiameter of 1,100 km and an orbital semi-major axis of 43.3 astronomical units.\nBased on stellar occultations observed between 2018 and 2021, an inhomogeneous\nring (Q1R, Quaoar's first ring) was detected around this body. Aims. A new\nstellar occultation by Quaoar was observed on August 9th, 2022 aiming to\nimprove Quaoar's shape models and the physical parameters of Q1R while\nsearching for additional material around the body. Methods. The occultation\nprovided nine effective chords across Quaoar, pinning down its size, shape, and\nastrometric position. Large facilities, such as Gemini North and the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), were used to obtain high acquisition\nrates and signal-to-noise ratios. The light curves were also used to\ncharacterize the Q1R ring (radial profiles and orbital elements). Results.\nQuaoar's elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields the limb with an\napparent semi-major axis of $579.5\\pm4.0$ km, apparent oblateness of\n$0.12\\pm0.01$, and area-equivalent radius of $543\\pm2$ km. Quaoar's limb\norientation is consistent with Q1R and Weywot orbiting in Quaoar's equatorial\nplane. The orbital radius of Q1R is refined to a value of $4,057\\pm6$ km. The\nradial opacity profile of the more opaque ring profile follows a Lorentzian\nshape that extends over 60 km, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of\n$\\sim5$ km and a peak normal optical depth of 0.4. Besides the secondary events\nrelated to the already reported rings, new secondary events detected during the\nAugust 2022 occultation in three different data sets are consistent with\nanother ring around Quaoar with a radius of $2,520\\pm20$ km, assuming the ring\nis circular and co-planar with Q1R. This new ring has a typical width of 10 km\nand a normal optical depth of $\\sim$0.004. Like Q1R, it also lies outside\nQuaoar's classical Roche limit.\n",

        "summary": "  We present the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), a mission that will produce the\nsharpest images in the history of astronomy by extending submillimeter\nVery-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to space. BHEX will discover and\nmeasure the bright and narrow \"photon ring\" that is predicted to exist in\nimages of black holes, produced from light that has orbited the black hole\nbefore escaping. This discovery will expose universal features of a black\nhole's spacetime that are distinct from the complex astrophysics of the\nemitting plasma, allowing the first direct measurements of a supermassive black\nhole's spin. In addition to studying the properties of the nearby supermassive\nblack holes M87* and Sgr A*, BHEX will measure the properties of dozens of\nadditional supermassive black holes, providing crucial insights into the\nprocesses that drive their creation and growth. BHEX will also connect these\nsupermassive black holes to their relativistic jets, elucidating the power\nsource for the brightest and most efficient engines in the universe. BHEX will\naddress fundamental open questions in the physics and astrophysics of black\nholes that cannot be answered without submillimeter space VLBI. The mission is\nenabled by recent technological breakthroughs, including the development of\nultra-high-speed downlink using laser communications, and it leverages billions\nof dollars of existing ground infrastructure. We present the motivation for\nBHEX, its science goals and associated requirements, and the pathway to launch\nwithin the next decade.\n",

        "summary": "  The last decade has brought about a profound transformation in multimessenger\nscience. Ten years ago, facilities had been built or were under construction\nthat would eventually discover the nature of objects in our universe could be\ndetected through multiple messengers. Nonetheless, multimessenger science was\nhardly more than a dream. The rewards for our foresight were finally realized\nthrough IceCube's discovery of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux, the\nfirst observation of gravitational waves by LIGO, and the first joint\ndetections in gravitational waves and photons and in neutrinos and photons.\nToday we live in the dawn of the multimessenger era. The successes of the\nmultimessenger campaigns of the last decade have pushed multimessenger science\nto the forefront of priority science areas in both the particle physics and the\nastrophysics communities. Multimessenger science provides new methods of\ntesting fundamental theories about the nature of matter and energy,\nparticularly in conditions that are not reproducible on Earth. This white paper\nwill present the science and facilities that will provide opportunities for the\nparticle physics community renew its commitment and maintain its leadership in\nmultimessenger science.\n",

        "summary": "  We present measurements and simulations of semiconductor-superconductor\nheterostructure devices that are consistent with the observation of topological\nsuperconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The devices are fabricated from\nhigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gases in which quasi-one-dimensional\nwires are defined by electrostatic gates. These devices enable measurements of\nlocal and non-local transport properties and have been optimized via extensive\nsimulations to ensure robustness against non-uniformity and disorder. Our main\nresult is that several devices, fabricated according to the design's\nengineering specifications, have passed the topological gap protocol defined in\nPikulin et al. [arXiv:2103.12217]. This protocol is a stringent test composed\nof a sequence of three-terminal local and non-local transport measurements\nperformed while varying the magnetic field, semiconductor electron density, and\njunction transparencies. Passing the protocol indicates a high probability of\ndetection of a topological phase hosting Majorana zero modes as determined by\nlarge-scale disorder simulations. Our experimental results are consistent with\na quantum phase transition into a topological superconducting phase that\nextends over several hundred millitesla in magnetic field and several\nmillivolts in gate voltage, corresponding to approximately one hundred\nmicro-electron-volts in Zeeman energy and chemical potential in the\nsemiconducting wire. These regions feature a closing and re-opening of the bulk\ngap, with simultaneous zero-bias conductance peaks at both ends of the devices\nthat withstand changes in the junction transparencies. The extracted maximum\ntopological gaps in our devices are 20-60 $\\mu$eV. This demonstration is a\nprerequisite for experiments involving fusion and braiding of Majorana zero\nmodes.\n",

        "summary": "  A Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) physics program of three LAr-TPC detectors\nlocated along the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab is presented. This\nnew SBN Program will deliver a rich and compelling physics opportunity,\nincluding the ability to resolve a class of experimental anomalies in neutrino\nphysics and to perform the most sensitive search to date for sterile neutrinos\nat the eV mass-scale through both appearance and disappearance oscillation\nchannels. Using data sets of 6.6e20 protons on target (P.O.T.) in the LAr1-ND\nand ICARUS T600 detectors plus 13.2e20 P.O.T. in the MicroBooNE detector, we\nestimate that a search for muon neutrino to electron neutrino appearance can be\nperformed with ~5 sigma sensitivity for the LSND allowed (99% C.L.) parameter\nregion. In this proposal for the SBN Program, we describe the physics analysis,\nthe conceptual design of the LAr1-ND detector, the design and refurbishment of\nthe T600 detector, the necessary infrastructure required to execute the\nprogram, and a possible reconfiguration of the BNB target and horn system to\nimprove its performance for oscillation searches.\n",

The DUNE far detector will be\na very large modular liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) located deep\nunderground, coupled to the LBNF multi-megawatt wide-band neutrino beam. DUNE\nwill also have a high-resolution and high-precision near detector.\n",

ProtoDUNE-SP, a crucial part of the DUNE effort towards the\nconstruction of the first DUNE 10-kt fiducial mass far detector module (17 kt\ntotal LAr mass), is a significant experiment in its own right. With a total\nliquid argon (LAr) mass of 0.77 kt, it represents the largest monolithic\nsingle-phase LArTPC detector to be built to date. It's technical design is\ngiven in this report.\n",

It is intended as an intermediate milestone on the path to a full TDR,\njustifying the technical choices that flow down from the high-level physics\ngoals through requirements at all levels of the Project. These design choices\nwill enable the DUNE experiment to make the ground-breaking discoveries that\nwill help to answer fundamental physics questions. Volume 2 describes the\nsingle-phase module's subsystems, the technical coordination required for its\ndesign, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational\nstructure.\n",

        "summary": "  The DUNE IDR describes the proposed physics program and technical designs of\nthe DUNE Far Detector modules in preparation for the full TDR to be published\nin 2019. It is intended as an intermediate milestone on the path to a full TDR,\njustifying the technical choices that flow down from the high-level physics\ngoals through requirements at all levels of the Project. These design choices\nwill enable the DUNE experiment to make the ground-breaking discoveries that\nwill help to answer fundamental physics questions. Volume 1 contains an\nexecutive summary that describes the general aims of this document. The\nremainder of this first volume provides a more detailed description of the DUNE\nphysics program that drives the choice of detector technologies. It also\nincludes concise outlines of two overarching systems that have not yet evolved\nto consortium structures: computing and calibration. Volumes 2 and 3 of this\nIDR describe, for the single-phase and dual-phase technologies, respectively,\neach detector module's subsystems, the technical coordination required for its\ndesign, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational\nstructure.\n",

It is intended as an intermediate milestone on the path to a full TDR,\njustifying the technical choices that flow down from the high-level physics\ngoals through requirements at all levels of the Project. These design choices\nwill enable the DUNE experiment to make the ground-breaking discoveries that\nwill help to answer fundamental physics questions. Volume 3 describes the\ndual-phase module's subsystems, the technical coordination required for its\ndesign, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational\nstructure.\n",

        "summary": "  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the\ndynamics of the supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life,\nand whether protons eventually decay -- these mysteries at the forefront of\nparticle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution\nof our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. The Deep Underground\nNeutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated\nto addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity\nsymmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and\nseeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory\nunderlying the standard model.\n  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE\nphysics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE\nliquid argon TPC far detector modules. This TDR is intended to justify the\ntechnical choices for the far detector that flow down from the high-level\nphysics goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. Volume I\ncontains an executive summary that introduces the DUNE science program, the far\ndetector and the strategy for its modular designs, and the organization and\nmanagement of the Project. The remainder of Volume I provides more detail on\nthe science program that drives the choice of detector technologies and on the\ntechnologies themselves. It also introduces the designs for the DUNE near\ndetector and the DUNE computing model, for which DUNE is planning design\nreports.\n  Volume II of this TDR describes DUNE's physics program in detail. Volume III\ndescribes the technical coordination required for the far detector design,\nconstruction, installation, and integration, and its organizational structure.\nVolume IV describes the single-phase far detector technology. A planned Volume\nV will describe the dual-phase technology.\n",

        "summary": "  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the\ndynamics of the supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life,\nand whether protons eventually decay -- these mysteries at the forefront of\nparticle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution\nof our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. DUNE is an\ninternational world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions as\nit searches for leptonic charge-parity symmetry violation, stands ready to\ncapture supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a\nsignature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model.\n  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE\nphysics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE\nliquid argon TPC far detector modules. Volume II of this TDR, DUNE Physics,\ndescribes the array of identified scientific opportunities and key goals.\nCrucially, we also report our best current understanding of the capability of\nDUNE to realize these goals, along with the detailed arguments and\ninvestigations on which this understanding is based.\n  This TDR volume documents the scientific basis underlying the conception and\ndesign of the LBNF/DUNE experimental configurations. As a result, the\ndescription of DUNE's experimental capabilities constitutes the bulk of the\ndocument. Key linkages between requirements for successful execution of the\nphysics program and primary specifications of the experimental configurations\nare drawn and summarized.\n  This document also serves a wider purpose as a statement on the scientific\npotential of DUNE as a central component within a global program of frontier\ntheoretical and experimental particle physics research.

        "summary": "  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the\ndynamics of the supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life,\nand whether protons eventually decay -- these mysteries at the forefront of\nparticle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution\nof our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. The Deep Underground\nNeutrino Experiment (DUNE) is an international world-class experiment dedicated\nto addressing these questions as it searches for leptonic charge-parity\nsymmetry violation, stands ready to capture supernova neutrino bursts, and\nseeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified theory\nunderlying the standard model.\n  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE\nphysics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE\nliquid argon TPC far detector modules. Volume III of this TDR describes how the\nactivities required to design, construct, fabricate, install, and commission\nthe DUNE far detector modules are organized and managed.\n  This volume details the organizational structures that will carry out and/or\noversee the planned far detector activities safely, successfully, on time, and\non budget. It presents overviews of the facilities, supporting infrastructure,\nand detectors for context, and it outlines the project-related functions and\nmethodologies used by the DUNE technical coordination organization, focusing on\nthe areas of integration engineering, technical reviews, quality assurance and\ncontrol, and safety oversight. Because of its more advanced stage of\ndevelopment, functional examples presented in this volume focus primarily on\nthe single-phase (SP) detector module.\n",

        "summary": "  The preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe, the\ndynamics of the supernovae that produced the heavy elements necessary for life,\nand whether protons eventually decay -- these mysteries at the forefront of\nparticle physics and astrophysics are key to understanding the early evolution\nof our universe, its current state, and its eventual fate. DUNE is an\ninternational world-class experiment dedicated to addressing these questions as\nit searches for leptonic charge-parity symmetry violation, stands ready to\ncapture supernova neutrino bursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a\nsignature of a grand unified theory underlying the standard model.\n  Central to achieving DUNE's physics program is a far detector that combines\nthe many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass necessary for rare event searches with\nsub-centimeter spatial resolution in its ability to image those events,\nallowing identification of the physics signatures among the numerous\nbackgrounds. In the single-phase liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC)\ntechnology, ionization charges drift horizontally in the liquid argon under the\ninfluence of an electric field towards a vertical anode, where they are read\nout with fine granularity. A photon detection system supplements the TPC,\ndirectly enhancing physics capabilities for all three DUNE physics drivers and\nopening up prospects for further physics explorations.\n  The DUNE far detector technical design report (TDR) describes the DUNE\nphysics program and the technical designs of the single- and dual-phase DUNE\nliquid argon TPC far detector modules. Volume IV presents an overview of the\nbasic operating principles of a single-phase LArTPC, followed by a description\nof the DUNE implementation. Each of the subsystems is described in detail,\nconnecting the high-level design requirements and decisions to the overriding\nphysics goals of DUNE.\n",

        "summary": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment is a next-generation neutrino\noscillation experiment that aims to measure $CP$-violation in the neutrino\nsector as part of a wider physics program. A deep learning approach based on a\nconvolutional neural network has been developed to provide highly efficient and\npure selections of electron neutrino and muon neutrino charged-current\ninteractions. The electron neutrino (antineutrino) selection efficiency peaks\nat 90% (94%) and exceeds 85% (90%) for reconstructed neutrino energies between\n2-5 GeV. The muon neutrino (antineutrino) event selection is found to have a\nmaximum efficiency of 96% (97%) and exceeds 90% (95%) efficiency for\nreconstructed neutrino energies above 2 GeV. When considering all electron\nneutrino and antineutrino interactions as signal, a selection purity of 90% is\nachieved. These event selections are critical to maximize the sensitivity of\nthe experiment to $CP$-violating effects.\n",

        "summary": "  The sensitivity of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to\nneutrino oscillation is determined, based on a full simulation, reconstruction,\nand event selection of the far detector and a full simulation and parameterized\nanalysis of the near detector. Detailed uncertainties due to the flux\nprediction, neutrino interaction model, and detector effects are included. DUNE\nwill resolve the neutrino mass ordering to a precision of 5$\\sigma$, for all\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{CP}}$ values, after 2 years of running with the nominal\ndetector design and beam configuration. It has the potential to observe\ncharge-parity violation in the neutrino sector to a precision of 3$\\sigma$\n(5$\\sigma$) after an exposure of 5 (10) years, for 50\\% of all\n$\\delta_{\\mathrm{CP}}$ values. It will also make precise measurements of other\nparameters governing long-baseline neutrino oscillation, and after an exposure\nof 15 years will achieve a similar sensitivity to $\\sin^{2} 2\\theta_{13}$ to\ncurrent reactor experiments.\n",

        "summary": "  The ProtoDUNE-SP detector is a single-phase liquid argon time projection\nchamber with an active volume of $7.2\\times 6.0\\times 6.9$ m$^3$. It is\ninstalled at the CERN Neutrino Platform in a specially-constructed beam that\ndelivers charged pions, kaons, protons, muons and electrons with momenta in the\nrange 0.3 GeV$/c$ to 7 GeV/$c$. Beam line instrumentation provides accurate\nmomentum measurements and particle identification. The ProtoDUNE-SP detector is\na prototype for the first far detector module of the Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment, and it incorporates full-size components as designed for that\nmodule. This paper describes the beam line, the time projection chamber, the\nphoton detectors, the cosmic-ray tagger, the signal processing and particle\nreconstruction. It presents the first results on ProtoDUNE-SP's performance,\nincluding noise and gain measurements, $dE/dx$ calibration for muons, protons,\npions and electrons, drift electron lifetime measurements, and photon detector\nnoise, signal sensitivity and time resolution measurements. The measured values\nmeet or exceed the specifications for the DUNE far detector, in several cases\nby large margins. ProtoDUNE-SP's successful operation starting in 2018 and its\nproduction of large samples of high-quality data demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the single-phase far detector design.\n",

        "summary": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), a 40-kton underground liquid\nargon time projection chamber experiment, will be sensitive to the\nelectron-neutrino flavor component of the burst of neutrinos expected from the\nnext Galactic core-collapse supernova. Such an observation will bring unique\ninsight into the astrophysics of core collapse as well as into the properties\nof neutrinos. The general capabilities of DUNE for neutrino detection in the\nrelevant few- to few-tens-of-MeV neutrino energy range will be described. As an\nexample, DUNE's ability to constrain the $\\nu_e$ spectral parameters of the\nneutrino burst will be considered.\n",

        "summary": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be a powerful tool for a\nvariety of physics topics. The high-intensity proton beams provide a large\nneutrino flux, sampled by a near detector system consisting of a combination of\ncapable precision detectors, and by the massive far detector system located\ndeep underground. This configuration sets up DUNE as a machine for discovery,\nas it enables opportunities not only to perform precision neutrino measurements\nthat may uncover deviations from the present three-flavor mixing paradigm, but\nalso to discover new particles and unveil new interactions and symmetries\nbeyond those predicted in the Standard Model (SM). Of the many potential beyond\nthe Standard Model (BSM) topics DUNE will probe, this paper presents a\nselection of studies quantifying DUNE's sensitivities to sterile neutrino\nmixing, heavy neutral leptons, non-standard interactions, CPT symmetry\nviolation, Lorentz invariance violation, neutrino trident production, dark\nmatter from both beam induced and cosmogenic sources, baryon number violation,\nand other new physics topics that complement those at high-energy colliders and\nsignificantly extend the present reach.\n",

        "summary": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment consisting of a high-power,\nbroadband neutrino beam, a highly capable near detector located on site at\nFermilab, in Batavia, Illinois, and a massive liquid argon time projection\nchamber (LArTPC) far detector located at the 4850L of Sanford Underground\nResearch Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The long-baseline physics sensitivity\ncalculations presented in the DUNE Physics TDR, and in a related physics paper,\nrely upon simulation of the neutrino beam line, simulation of neutrino\ninteractions in the near and far detectors, fully automated event\nreconstruction and neutrino classification, and detailed implementation of\nsystematic uncertainties. The purpose of this posting is to provide a\nsimplified summary of the simulations that went into this analysis to the\ncommunity, in order to facilitate phenomenological studies of long-baseline\noscillation at DUNE. Simulated neutrino flux files and a GLoBES configuration\ndescribing the far detector reconstruction and selection performance are\nincluded as ancillary files to this posting. A simple analysis using these\nconfigurations in GLoBES produces sensitivity that is similar, but not\nidentical, to the official DUNE sensitivity. DUNE welcomes those interested in\nperforming phenomenological work as members of the collaboration, but also\nrecognizes the benefit of making these configurations readily available to the\nwider community.\n",

        "summary": "  The observation of 236 MeV muon neutrinos from kaon-decay-at-rest (KDAR)\noriginating in the core of the Sun would provide a unique signature of dark\nmatter annihilation. Since excellent angle and energy reconstruction are\nnecessary to detect this monoenergetic, directional neutrino flux, DUNE with\nits vast volume and reconstruction capabilities, is a promising candidate for a\nKDAR neutrino search. In this work, we evaluate the proposed KDAR neutrino\nsearch strategies by realistically modeling both neutrino-nucleus interactions\nand the response of DUNE. We find that, although reconstruction of the neutrino\nenergy and direction is difficult with current techniques in the relevant\nenergy range, the superb energy resolution, angular resolution, and particle\nidentification offered by DUNE can still permit great signal/background\ndiscrimination. Moreover, there are non-standard scenarios in which searches at\nDUNE for KDAR in the Sun can probe dark matter interactions.\n",

        "summary": "  The ProtoDUNE-SP detector is a single-phase liquid argon time projection\nchamber (LArTPC) that was constructed and operated in the CERN North Area at\nthe end of the H4 beamline. This detector is a prototype for the first far\ndetector module of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which will\nbe constructed at the Sandford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead,\nSouth Dakota, USA. The ProtoDUNE-SP detector incorporates full-size components\nas designed for DUNE and has an active volume of $7\\times 6\\times 7.2$~m$^3$.\nThe H4 beam delivers incident particles with well-measured momenta and\nhigh-purity particle identification. ProtoDUNE-SP's successful operation\nbetween 2018 and 2020 demonstrates the effectiveness of the single-phase far\ndetector design. This paper describes the design, construction, assembly and\noperation of the detector components.\n",

        "summary": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will produce world-leading\nneutrino oscillation measurements over the lifetime of the experiment. In this\nwork, we explore DUNE's sensitivity to observe charge-parity violation (CPV) in\nthe neutrino sector, and to resolve the mass ordering, for exposures of up to\n100 kiloton-megawatt-years (kt-MW-yr). The analysis includes detailed\nuncertainties on the flux prediction, the neutrino interaction model, and\ndetector effects. We demonstrate that DUNE will be able to unambiguously\nresolve the neutrino mass ordering at a 3$\\sigma$ (5$\\sigma$) level, with a 66\n(100) kt-MW-yr far detector exposure, and has the ability to make strong\nstatements at significantly shorter exposures depending on the true value of\nother oscillation parameters. We also show that DUNE has the potential to make\na robust measurement of CPV at a 3$\\sigma$ level with a 100 kt-MW-yr exposure\nfor the maximally CP-violating values $\\delta_{\\rm CP}} = \\pm\\pi/2$.\nAdditionally, the dependence of DUNE's sensitivity on the exposure taken in\nneutrino-enhanced and antineutrino-enhanced running is discussed. An equal\nfraction of exposure taken in each beam mode is found to be close to optimal\nwhen considered over the entire space of interest.\n",

        "summary": "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment with a primary physics goal of\nobserving neutrino and antineutrino oscillation patterns to precisely measure\nthe parameters governing long-baseline neutrino oscillation in a single\nexperiment, and to test the three-flavor paradigm. DUNE's design has been\ndeveloped by a large, international collaboration of scientists and engineers\nto have unique capability to measure neutrino oscillation as a function of\nenergy in a broadband beam, to resolve degeneracy among oscillation parameters,\nand to control systematic uncertainty using the exquisite imaging capability of\nmassive LArTPC far detector modules and an argon-based near detector. DUNE's\nneutrino oscillation measurements will unambiguously resolve the neutrino mass\nordering and provide the sensitivity to discover CP violation in neutrinos for\na wide range of possible values of $\\delta_{CP}$. DUNE is also uniquely\nsensitive to electron neutrinos from a galactic supernova burst, and to a broad\nrange of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), including nucleon decays.\nDUNE is anticipated to begin collecting physics data with Phase I, an initial\nexperiment configuration consisting of two far detector modules and a minimal\nsuite of near detector components, with a 1.2 MW proton beam. To realize its\nextensive, world-leading physics potential requires the full scope of DUNE be\ncompleted in Phase II. The three Phase II upgrades are all necessary to achieve\nDUNE's physics goals: (1) addition of far detector modules three and four for a\ntotal FD fiducial mass of at least 40 kt, (2) upgrade of the proton beam power\nfrom 1.2 MW to 2.4 MW, and (3) replacement of the near detector's temporary\nmuon spectrometer with a magnetized, high-pressure gaseous argon TPC and\ncalorimeter.\n",

        "summary": "  This document presents the concept and physics case for a magnetized gaseous\nargon-based detector system (ND-GAr) for the Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE) Near Detector. This detector system is required in order for\nDUNE to reach its full physics potential in the measurement of CP violation and\nin delivering precision measurements of oscillation parameters. In addition to\nits critical role in the long-baseline oscillation program, ND-GAr will extend\nthe overall physics program of DUNE. The LBNF high-intensity proton beam will\nprovide a large flux of neutrinos that is sampled by ND-GAr, enabling DUNE to\ndiscover new particles and search for new interactions and symmetries beyond\nthose predicted in the Standard Model.\n",

        "summary": "  DUNE is a dual-site experiment for long-baseline neutrino oscillation\nstudies, neutrino astrophysics and nucleon decay searches. ProtoDUNE Dual Phase\n(DP) is a 6x6x6m3 liquid argon time-projection-chamber (LArTPC) that recorded\ncosmic-muon data at the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2019-2020 as a prototype of\nthe DUNE Far Detector. Charged particles propagating through the LArTPC produce\nionization and scintillation light. The scintillation light signal in these\ndetectors can provide the trigger for non-beam events. In addition, it adds\nprecise timing capabilities and improves the calorimetry measurements. In\nProtoDUNE-DP, scintillation and electroluminescence light produced by cosmic\nmuons in the LArTPC is collected by photomultiplier tubes placed up to 7 m away\nfrom the ionizing track. In this paper, the ProtoDUNE-DP photon detection\nsystem performance is evaluated with a particular focus on the different\nwavelength shifters, such as PEN and TPB, and the use of Xe-doped LAr,\nconsidering its future use in giant LArTPCs. The scintillation light production\nand propagation processes are analyzed and a comparison of simulation to data\nis performed, improving understanding of the liquid argon properties\n",

        "summary": "  Liquid argon time projection chamber detector technology provides high\nspatial and calorimetric resolutions on the charged particles traversing liquid\nargon. As a result, the technology has been used in a number of recent neutrino\nexperiments, and is the technology of choice for the Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE). In order to perform high precision measurements of neutrinos\nin the detector, final state particles need to be effectively identified, and\ntheir energy accurately reconstructed. This article proposes an algorithm based\non a convolutional neural network to perform the classification of energy\ndeposits and reconstructed particles as track-like or arising from\nelectromagnetic cascades. Results from testing the algorithm on data from\nProtoDUNE-SP, a prototype of the DUNE far detector, are presented. The network\nidentifies track- and shower-like particles, as well as Michel electrons, with\nhigh efficiency. The performance of the algorithm is consistent between data\nand simulation.\n",

        "summary": "  The Pandora Software Development Kit and algorithm libraries provide\npattern-recognition logic essential to the reconstruction of particle\ninteractions in liquid argon time projection chamber detectors. Pandora is the\nprimary event reconstruction software used at ProtoDUNE-SP, a prototype for the\nDeep Underground Neutrino Experiment far detector. ProtoDUNE-SP, located at\nCERN, is exposed to a charged-particle test beam. This paper gives an overview\nof the Pandora reconstruction algorithms and how they have been tailored for\nuse at ProtoDUNE-SP. In complex events with numerous cosmic-ray and beam\nbackground particles, the simulated reconstruction and identification\nefficiency for triggered test-beam particles is above 80% for the majority of\nparticle type and beam momentum combinations. Specifically, simulated 1 GeV/$c$\ncharged pions and protons are correctly reconstructed and identified with\nefficiencies of 86.1$\\pm0.6$% and 84.1$\\pm0.6$%, respectively. The efficiencies\nmeasured for test-beam data are shown to be within 5% of those predicted by the\nsimulation.\n",

        "summary": "  Measurements of electrons from $\\nu_e$ interactions are crucial for the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) neutrino oscillation program, as well as\nsearches for physics beyond the standard model, supernova neutrino detection,\nand solar neutrino measurements. This article describes the selection and\nreconstruction of low-energy (Michel) electrons in the ProtoDUNE-SP detector.\nProtoDUNE-SP is one of the prototypes for the DUNE far detector, built and\noperated at CERN as a charged particle test beam experiment. A sample of\nlow-energy electrons produced by the decay of cosmic muons is selected with a\npurity of 95%. This sample is used to calibrate the low-energy electron energy\nscale with two techniques. An electron energy calibration based on a cosmic ray\nmuon sample uses calibration constants derived from measured and simulated\ncosmic ray muon events. Another calibration technique makes use of the\ntheoretically well-understood Michel electron energy spectrum to convert\nreconstructed charge to electron energy. In addition, the effects of detector\nresponse to low-energy electron energy scale and its resolution including\nreadout electronics threshold effects are quantified. Finally, the relation\nbetween the theoretical and reconstructed low-energy electron energy spectrum\nis derived and the energy resolution is characterized. The low-energy electron\nselection presented here accounts for about 75% of the total electron deposited\nenergy. After the addition of lost energy using a Monte Carlo simulation, the\nenergy resolution improves from about 40% to 25% at 50~MeV. These results are\nused to validate the expected capabilities of the DUNE far detector to\nreconstruct low-energy electrons.\n",

        "summary": "  The rapid development of general-purpose computing on graphics processing\nunits (GPGPU) is allowing the implementation of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo\nsimulation chains for particle physics experiments. This technique is\nparticularly suitable for the simulation of a pixelated charge readout for time\nprojection chambers, given the large number of channels that this technology\nemploys. Here we present the first implementation of a full microphysical\nsimulator of a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) equipped with\nlight readout and pixelated charge readout, developed for the DUNE Near\nDetector. The software is implemented with an end-to-end set of GPU-optimized\nalgorithms. The algorithms have been written in Python and translated into CUDA\nkernels using Numba, a just-in-time compiler for a subset of Python and NumPy\ninstructions. The GPU implementation achieves a speed up of four orders of\nmagnitude compared with the equivalent CPU version. The simulation of the\ncurrent induced on $10^3$ pixels takes around 1 ms on the GPU, compared with\napproximately 10 s on the CPU. The results of the simulation are compared\nagainst data from a pixel-readout LArTPC prototype.\n",

        "summary": "  A primary goal of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is\nto measure the $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV neutrinos produced by a Galactic\ncore-collapse supernova if one should occur during the lifetime of the\nexperiment. The liquid-argon-based detectors planned for DUNE are expected to\nbe uniquely sensitive to the $\\nu_e$ component of the supernova flux, enabling\na wide variety of physics and astrophysics measurements. A key requirement for\na correct interpretation of these measurements is a good understanding of the\nenergy-dependent total cross section $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ for charged-current\n$\\nu_e$ absorption on argon. In the context of a simulated extraction of\nsupernova $\\nu_e$ spectral parameters from a toy analysis, we investigate the\nimpact of $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ modeling uncertainties on DUNE's supernova neutrino\nphysics sensitivity for the first time. We find that the currently large\ntheoretical uncertainties on $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ must be substantially reduced\nbefore the $\\nu_e$ flux parameters can be extracted reliably: in the absence of\nexternal constraints, a measurement of the integrated neutrino luminosity with\nless than 10\\% bias with DUNE requires $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$ to be known to about 5%.\nThe neutrino spectral shape parameters can be known to better than 10% for a\n20% uncertainty on the cross-section scale, although they will be sensitive to\nuncertainties on the shape of $\\sigma(E_\\nu)$. A direct measurement of\nlow-energy $\\nu_e$-argon scattering would be invaluable for improving the\ntheoretical precision to the needed level.\n",

        "summary": "  DUNE is an international experiment dedicated to addressing some of the\nquestions at the forefront of particle physics and astrophysics, including the\nmystifying preponderance of matter over antimatter in the early universe. The\ndual-site experiment will employ an intense neutrino beam focused on a near and\na far detector as it aims to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy and to make\nhigh-precision measurements of the PMNS matrix parameters, including the\nCP-violating phase. It will also stand ready to observe supernova neutrino\nbursts, and seeks to observe nucleon decay as a signature of a grand unified\ntheory underlying the standard model.\n  The DUNE far detector implements liquid argon time-projection chamber\n(LArTPC) technology, and combines the many tens-of-kiloton fiducial mass\nnecessary for rare event searches with the sub-centimeter spatial resolution\nrequired to image those events with high precision. The addition of a photon\ndetection system enhances physics capabilities for all DUNE physics drivers and\nopens prospects for further physics explorations. Given its size, the far\ndetector will be implemented as a set of modules, with LArTPC designs that\ndiffer from one another as newer technologies arise.\n  In the vertical drift LArTPC design, a horizontal cathode bisects the\ndetector, creating two stacked drift volumes in which ionization charges drift\ntowards anodes at either the top or bottom. The anodes are composed of\nperforated PCB layers with conductive strips, enabling reconstruction in 3D.\nLight-trap-style photon detection modules are placed both on the cryostat's\nside walls and on the central cathode where they are optically powered.\n  This Technical Design Report describes in detail the technical\nimplementations of each subsystem of this LArTPC that, together with the other\nfar detector modules and the near detector, will enable DUNE to achieve its\nphysics goals.\n",

        "summary": "  Doping of liquid argon TPCs (LArTPCs) with a small concentration of xenon is\na technique for light-shifting and facilitates the detection of the liquid\nargon scintillation light. In this paper, we present the results of the first\ndoping test ever performed in a kiloton-scale LArTPC. From February to May\n2020, we carried out this special run in the single-phase DUNE Far Detector\nprototype (ProtoDUNE-SP) at CERN, featuring 720 t of total liquid argon mass\nwith 410 t of fiducial mass. A 5.4 ppm nitrogen contamination was present\nduring the xenon doping campaign. The goal of the run was to measure the light\nand charge response of the detector to the addition of xenon, up to a\nconcentration of 18.8 ppm. The main purpose was to test the possibility for\nreduction of non-uniformities in light collection, caused by deployment of\nphoton detectors only within the anode planes. Light collection was analysed as\na function of the xenon concentration, by using the pre-existing photon\ndetection system (PDS) of ProtoDUNE-SP and an additional smaller set-up\ninstalled specifically for this run. In this paper we first summarize our\ncurrent understanding of the argon-xenon energy transfer process and the impact\nof the presence of nitrogen in argon with and without xenon dopant. We then\ndescribe the key elements of ProtoDUNE-SP and the injection method deployed.\nTwo dedicated photon detectors were able to collect the light produced by xenon\nand the total light. The ratio of these components was measured to be about\n0.65 as 18.8 ppm of xenon were injected. We performed studies of the collection\nefficiency as a function of the distance between tracks and light detectors,\ndemonstrating enhanced uniformity of response for the anode-mounted PDS. We\nalso show that xenon doping can substantially recover light losses due to\ncontamination of the liquid argon by nitrogen.\n",

        "summary": "  The Module-0 Demonstrator is a single-phase 600 kg liquid argon time\nprojection chamber operated as a prototype for the DUNE liquid argon near\ndetector. Based on the ArgonCube design concept, Module-0 features a novel\n80k-channel pixelated charge readout and advanced high-coverage photon\ndetection system. In this paper, we present an analysis of an eight-day data\nset consisting of 25 million cosmic ray events collected in the spring of 2021.\nWe use this sample to demonstrate the imaging performance of the charge and\nlight readout systems as well as the signal correlations between the two. We\nalso report argon purity and detector uniformity measurements, and provide\ncomparisons to detector simulations.\n",

        "summary": "  The determination of the direction of a stellar core collapse via its\nneutrino emission is crucial for the identification of the progenitor for a\nmultimessenger follow-up. A highly effective method of reconstructing supernova\ndirections within the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is\nintroduced. The supernova neutrino pointing resolution is studied by simulating\nand reconstructing electron-neutrino charged-current absorption on $^{40}$Ar\nand elastic scattering of neutrinos on electrons. Procedures to reconstruct\nindividual interactions, including a newly developed technique called ``brems\nflipping'', as well as the burst direction from an ensemble of interactions are\ndescribed. Performance of the burst direction reconstruction is evaluated for\nsupernovae happening at a distance of 10 kpc for a specific supernova burst\nflux model. The pointing resolution is found to be 3.4 degrees at 68% coverage\nfor a perfect interaction-channel classification and a fiducial mass of 40\nkton, and 6.6 degrees for a 10 kton fiducial mass respectively. Assuming a 4%\nrate of charged-current interactions being misidentified as elastic scattering,\nDUNE's burst pointing resolution is found to be 4.3 degrees (8.7 degrees) at\n68% coverage.\n",

        "summary": "  The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility\n(LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy toward the implementation of this\nleading-edge, large-scale science project. The 2023 report of the US Particle\nPhysics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) reaffirmed this vision and strongly\nendorsed DUNE Phase I and Phase II, as did the European Strategy for Particle\nPhysics. While the construction of the DUNE Phase I is well underway, this\nWhite Paper focuses on DUNE Phase II planning. DUNE Phase-II consists of a\nthird and fourth far detector (FD) module, an upgraded near detector complex,\nand an enhanced 2.1 MW beam. The fourth FD module is conceived as a \"Module of\nOpportunity\", aimed at expanding the physics opportunities, in addition to\nsupporting the core DUNE science program, with more advanced technologies. This\ndocument highlights the increased science opportunities offered by the DUNE\nPhase II near and far detectors, including long-baseline neutrino oscillation\nphysics, neutrino astrophysics, and physics beyond the standard model. It\ndescribes the DUNE Phase II near and far detector technologies and detector\ndesign concepts that are currently under consideration. A summary of key R&D\ngoals and prototyping phases needed to realize the Phase II detector technical\ndesigns is also provided. DUNE's Phase II detectors, along with the increased\nbeam power, will complete the full scope of DUNE, enabling a multi-decadal\nprogram of groundbreaking science with neutrinos.\n",

        "summary": "  This paper introduces a novel track-length extension fitting algorithm for\nmeasuring the kinetic energies of inelastically interacting particles in liquid\nargon time projection chambers (LArTPCs). The algorithm finds the most probable\noffset in track length for a track-like object by comparing the measured\nionization density as a function of position with a theoretical prediction of\nthe energy loss as a function of the energy, including models of electron\nrecombination and detector response. The algorithm can be used to measure the\nenergies of particles that interact before they stop, such as charged pions\nthat are absorbed by argon nuclei. The algorithm's energy measurement\nresolutions and fractional biases are presented as functions of particle\nkinetic energy and number of track hits using samples of stopping secondary\ncharged pions in data collected by the ProtoDUNE-SP detector, and also in a\ndetailed simulation. Additional studies describe the impact of the dE/dx model\non energy measurement performance. The method described in this paper to\ncharacterize the energy measurement performance can be repeated in any LArTPC\nexperiment using stopping secondary charged pions.\n",

        "summary": "  The Pandora Software Development Kit and algorithm libraries perform\nreconstruction of neutrino interactions in liquid argon time projection chamber\ndetectors. Pandora is the primary event reconstruction software used at the\nDeep Underground Neutrino Experiment, which will operate four large-scale\nliquid argon time projection chambers at the far detector site in South Dakota,\nproducing high-resolution images of charged particles emerging from neutrino\ninteractions. While these high-resolution images provide excellent\nopportunities for physics, the complex topologies require sophisticated pattern\nrecognition capabilities to interpret signals from the detectors as physically\nmeaningful objects that form the inputs to physics analyses. A critical\ncomponent is the identification of the neutrino interaction vertex. Subsequent\nreconstruction algorithms use this location to identify the individual primary\nparticles and ensure they each result in a separate reconstructed particle. A\nnew vertex-finding procedure described in this article integrates a U-ResNet\nneural network performing hit-level classification into the multi-algorithm\napproach used by Pandora to identify the neutrino interaction vertex. The\nmachine learning solution is seamlessly integrated into a chain of\npattern-recognition algorithms. The technique substantially outperforms the\nprevious BDT-based solution, with a more than 20\\% increase in the efficiency\nof sub-1\\,cm vertex reconstruction across all neutrino flavours.\n",

        "summary": "  The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility\n(LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy for the implementation of this\nleading-edge, large-scale science project. The 2023 report of the US Particle\nPhysics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) reaffirmed this vision and strongly\nendorsed DUNE Phase I and Phase II, as did the previous European Strategy for\nParticle Physics. The construction of DUNE Phase I is well underway. DUNE Phase\nII consists of a third and fourth far detector module, an upgraded near\ndetector complex, and an enhanced > 2 MW beam. The fourth FD module is\nconceived as a 'Module of Opportunity', aimed at supporting the core DUNE\nscience program while also expanding the physics opportunities with more\nadvanced technologies. The DUNE collaboration is submitting four main\ncontributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics\nprocess. This submission to the 'Neutrinos and cosmic messengers', 'BSM\nphysics' and 'Dark matter and dark sector' streams focuses on the physics\nprogram of DUNE. Additional inputs related to DUNE detector technologies and\nR&D, DUNE software and computing, and European contributions to Fermilab\naccelerator upgrades and facilities for the DUNE experiment, are also being\nsubmitted to other streams.\n",

        "summary": "  The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility\n(LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy for the implementation of this\nleading-edge, large-scale science project. The 2023 report of the US Particle\nPhysics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) reaffirmed this vision and strongly\nendorsed DUNE Phase I and Phase II, as did the previous European Strategy for\nParticle Physics. The construction of DUNE Phase I is well underway. DUNE Phase\nII consists of a third and fourth far detector module, an upgraded near\ndetector complex, and an enhanced > 2 MW beam. The fourth FD module is\nconceived as a 'Module of Opportunity', aimed at supporting the core DUNE\nscience program while also expanding the physics opportunities with more\nadvanced technologies. The DUNE collaboration is submitting four main\ncontributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics\nprocess. This submission to the 'Detector instrumentation' stream focuses on\ntechnologies and R&D for the DUNE Phase II detectors. Additional inputs related\nto the DUNE science program, DUNE software and computing, and European\ncontributions to Fermilab accelerator upgrades and facilities for the DUNE\nexperiment, are also being submitted to other streams.\n",

        "summary": "  The international collaboration designing and constructing the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility\n(LBNF) has developed a two-phase strategy toward the implementation of this\nleading-edge, large-scale science project. The ambitious physics program of\nPhase I and Phase II of DUNE is dependent upon deployment and utilization of\nsignificant computing resources, and successful research and development of\nsoftware (both infrastructure and algorithmic) in order to achieve these\nscientific goals. This submission discusses the computing resources\nprojections, infrastructure support, and software development needed for DUNE\nduring the coming decades as an input to the European Strategy for Particle\nPhysics Update for 2026. The DUNE collaboration is submitting four main\ncontributions to the 2026 Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics\nprocess. This submission to the 'Computing' stream focuses on DUNE software and\ncomputing. Additional inputs related to the DUNE science program, DUNE detector\ntechnologies and R&D, and European contributions to Fermilab accelerator\nupgrades and facilities for the DUNE experiment, are also being submitted to\nother streams.\n",

        "summary": "  The Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II) to the FNAL accelerator chain and the\nLong-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) will provide the world's most intense\nneutrino beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) enabling a\nwide-ranging physics program. This document outlines the significant\ncontributions made by European national laboratories and institutes towards\nrealizing the first phase of the project with a 1.2 MW neutrino beam.\nConstruction of this first phase is well underway. For DUNE Phase II, this will\nbe closely followed by an upgrade of the beam power to > 2 MW, for which the\nEuropean groups again have a key role and which will require the continued\nsupport of the European community for machine aspects of neutrino physics.\nBeyond the neutrino beam aspects, LBNF is also responsible for providing unique\ninfrastructure to install and operate the DUNE neutrino detectors at FNAL and\nat the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). The cryostats for the\nfirst two Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber detector modules at SURF, a\ncontribution of CERN to LBNF, are central to the success of the ongoing\nexecution of DUNE Phase I. Likewise, successful and timely procurement of\ncryostats for two additional detector modules at SURF will be critical to the\nsuccess of DUNE Phase II and the overall physics program. The DUNE\nCollaboration is submitting four main contributions to the 2026 Update of the\nEuropean Strategy for Particle Physics process. This paper is being submitted\nto the 'Accelerator technologies' and 'Projects and Large Experiments' streams.\nAdditional inputs related to the DUNE science program, DUNE detector\ntechnologies and R&D, and DUNE software and computing, are also being submitted\nto other streams.\n",

        "summary": "  Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) rely on highly pure argon to\nensure that ionization electrons produced by charged particles reach readout\narrays. ProtoDUNE Single-Phase (ProtoDUNE-SP) was an approximately 700-ton\nliquid argon detector intended to prototype the Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE) Far Detector Horizontal Drift module. It contains two drift\nvolumes bisected by the cathode plane assembly, which is biased to create an\nalmost uniform electric field in both volumes. The DUNE Far Detector modules\nmust have robust cryogenic systems capable of filtering argon and supplying the\nTPC with clean liquid. This paper will explore comparisons of the argon purity\nmeasured by the purity monitors with those measured using muons in the TPC from\nOctober 2018 to November 2018. A new method is introduced to measure the liquid\nargon purity in the TPC using muons crossing both drift volumes of\nProtoDUNE-SP. For extended periods on the timescale of weeks, the drift\nelectron lifetime was measured to be above 30 ms using both systems. A\nparticular focus will be placed on the measured purity of argon as a function\nof position in the detector.\n",

        "id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07012v1",
        "published": "2025-09-06T12:48:49Z",
        "summary": "  The 2x2 Demonstrator, a prototype for the Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE) liquid argon (LAr) Near Detector, was exposed to the\nNeutrinos from the Main Injector (NuMI) neutrino beam at Fermi National\nAccelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). This detector prototypes a new modular\ndesign for a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC), comprised of a\ntwo-by-two array of four modules, each further segmented into two\noptically-isolated LArTPCs. The 2x2 Demonstrator features a number of\npioneering technologies, including a low-profile resistive field shell to\nestablish drift fields, native 3D ionization pixelated imaging, and a\nhigh-coverage dielectric light readout system. The 2.4 tonne active mass\ndetector is flanked upstream and downstream by supplemental solid-scintillator\ntracking planes, repurposed from the MINERvA experiment, which track ionizing\nparticles exiting the argon volume. The antineutrino beam data collected by the\ndetector over a 4.5 day period in 2024 include over 30,000 neutrino\ninteractions in the LAr active volume-the first neutrino interactions reported\nby a DUNE detector prototype. During its physics-quality run, the 2x2\nDemonstrator operated at a nominal drift field of 500 V/cm and maintained good\nLAr purity, with a stable electron lifetime of approximately 1.25 ms. This\npaper describes the detector and supporting systems, summarizes the\ninstallation and commissioning, and presents the initial validation of\ncollected NuMI beam and off-beam self-triggers. In addition, it highlights\nobserved interactions in the detector volume, including candidate muon\nanti-neutrino events.\n",

        "summary": "  Neutrino-nucleus cross-section measurements are critical for future neutrino\noscillation analyses. However, our models to describe them require further\nrefinement, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential\nfor future neutrino oscillation experiments to realize their ambitious physics\ngoals. Current neutrino cross-section measurements provide clear deficiencies\nin neutrino interaction modeling, but almost all are reported averaged over\nbroad neutrino fluxes, rendering their interpretation challenging. Using the\nDUNE-PRISM concept (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment Precision Reaction\nIndependent Spectrum Measurement) -- a movable near detector that samples\nmultiple off-axis positions -- neutrino interaction measurements can be used to\nconstruct narrow virtual fluxes (less than 100 MeV wide). These fluxes can be\nused to extract charged-current neutrino-nucleus cross sections as functions of\noutgoing lepton kinematics within specific neutrino energy ranges. Based on a\ndedicated simulation with realistic event statistics and flux-related\nsystematic uncertainties, but assuming an almost-perfect detector, we run a\nfeasibility study demonstrating how DUNE-PRISM data can be used to measure muon\nneutrino charged-current integrated and differential cross sections over narrow\nfluxes. We find that this approach enables a model independent reconstruction\nof powerful observables, including energy transfer, typically accessible only\nin electron scattering measurements, but that large exposures may be required\nfor differential cross-section measurements with few-\\% statistical\nuncertainties.\n",
